# jsPlumb

If you're new to jsPlumb, please do take the time to read the [documentation](https://docs.jsplumbtoolkit.com/community/). 
There are a few integration issues that you should be aware of: z-index needs special attention, for example.

This project is the 'Community Edition' of jsPlumb. The 'Toolkit Edition' is a commercially-licensed wrapper around this. 

**This project is not the correct place to report issues for the Toolkit edition**. The Toolkit is not a public project. Issues reported for the Toolkit edition in this issue tracker will be deleted.

This is version 6.x of the jsPlumb Community Edition.


## Packages

In 6.x we have dispensed with the multiple packages from 5.x and we now ship a single package. If you're using a bundler with tree shaking, as the vast majority of people are nowadays, you'll get a smaller bundle size with 6.x than you did with 5.x as it is more compatible with tree shaking.

The single import for 6.x is:

```json
{
  "@jsplumb/browser-ui":"^6.0,0"
}
``` 

### What if I'm not using a package manager?

If you're not using a package manager at all then you can use the UMD that ships in the jsPlumb package.

```html
<script src="node_modues/@jsplumb/browser-ui/js/jsplumb-browser-ui.umd.js"></script>
```
