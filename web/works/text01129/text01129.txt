The Fiancée of the Timbalier

À M. J. F.

My Lord the Duke of Brittany
For deadly combat gave the call —
From Nantes to Mortagne,
From mountain to plain —
To his warrior vassals all.

There are barons whose shields adorn
Their forts with moats around them,
Knights grown old in wars,
Squires, and men-at-arms —
My fiancé is among them.

He set out for Aquitaine
As timbalier, but truth be told
You’d think him captain
So proud is his bearing
So bright his doublet of gold.

Since that day I shake with fear.
His fate I joined with mine, and said,
“Saint Bridget, my Patron,
Please make sure his saint
Keeps him always in good stead!”

I said to our Abbot, “Father,
Pray well for all our soldiers!”
And, knowing his wishes,
Burned three wax candles
On the shrine of St. Gildas.

To Our Lady of Loretto
In dark grief I vowed as well
To pin to my collar,
Closed to prying eyes,
The pilgrim’s scallop shell.

He could not, by tokens of love,
Console me by my fire:
To send tender words
This vassal has no page,
That vassal has no squire.

Today’s the day he will come back
From campaigning with my Lord —
Now no common lover!
I raise my forehead:
Joyful pride is my reward.

The triumphant Duke brings back to us
His battle-banner still unscathed;
To the Old Gate we’ll go
To see the escort pass,
And the Prince, and my betrothed.

Come see his horse caparisoned
For this great day; he’ll neigh and prance
And stop and start again,
And shake his head
To make his red feathers dance.

My sisters, you dress so slowly!
Next to my conqueror — come and look —
Those sparkling timbales
Trembling at his hand!
My heart will leap at every stroke.

Come most of all to see my love!
I embroidered the cloak he’ll wear.
How fine he’ll look!
He’ll wear like a crown
His helmet topped with horsehair.

Yesterday that hateful woman
The Gypsy drew me aside to sneer:
Today (God save us!)
The fanfare of the march
Would lack one timbalier.

I prayed so much I still have hope!
I won’t give in to sorrow!
She showed me a tomb;
She hissed like a snake,
“I’ll meet you there tomorrow.”

Let’s go! I’ll think no more black thoughts!
It’s the drums at last I hear.
The ladies are gathered,
The tents all in purple,
The flowers and flags in the air.

In double ranks the cortege flows.
The pikemen first with heavy steps.
Then, their flags unfurled,
Come noble barons,
In silken robes and velvet caps.

See the chasubles of the priests,
The heralds on their white steeds.
All wear on their suits
Their lords’ coats-of-arms,
Reminders of heroic deeds.

Marvel at the Persian armor
Of the Templars, feared by hell;
And with long halberds
The archers from Lausanne
Dressed in buff and armed in steel.

The Duke’s not far — see his banners
Float among the chevaliers;
Same captured standards
In disgrace go past ...
Sisters! Now the timbaliers!

She spoke, and through the marching ranks
Her eager eye, alas, she cast,
Then into the crowd
Fell, cold and dying ...
The timbaliers had passed.
