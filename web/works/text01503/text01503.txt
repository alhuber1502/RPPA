How murderous is the false faith of the rose! ...

How murderous is the false faith of the rose!
The nightingale’s doings amuse the rose.

Celebrate the breeze’s freedom: everywhere lie broken
The meshes of the desire-net of the rose.

Deceived, everyone fell for its wave of color.
Oh, the lament of the bloody-voiced lip of the rose!

How happy is that drunken one who, like the rose’s shadow
Rests his head on the foot of the rose.

They make me ashamed before the spring breeze —
My cup without wine, my heart without desire for the rose.

Your jealous beauty appears in such supreme glory —
Mere blood in my eyes is the charming color of the rose.

Even now, deceived, thinking it to be you   
The rose runs recklessly after the rose.

Ghalib, I long to embrace her.
The thought of whom is the rose on the dress of the rose.
