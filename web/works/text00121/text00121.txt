Songs of Experience

[‘Introduction’]

Hear the voice of the bard
 Who present, past, and future sees,
 Whose ears have heard
 The Holy Word
 That walked among the ancient trees

Calling the laps
                ed
               soul,
 And weeping in the evening dew –
 That might control
 The starry pole,
 And fallen, fallen, light renew! 

Oh Earth, oh Earth return,
 Arise from out the dewy grass! 
Night is worn,
 And the morn
 Rises from the slumberous mass. 

Turn away no more –
 Why wilt thou turn away? 
The starry floor,
 The watery shore,
 Is given thee till the break of day.
