The Cock Is Crowing

The cock is crowing,
 The stream is flowing,
 The small birds twitter,
 The lake doth glitter,
 The green field sleeps in the sun;
 The oldest and youngest
 Are at work with the strongest;
 The cattle are grazing,
 Their heads never raising –
 There are forty feeding like one! 

Like an army defeated
 The snow hath retreated
 And now doth fare ill
 On the top of the bare hill;
 The ploughboy is whooping, anon, anon –
 There’s joy in the mountains,
 There’s life in the fountains,
 Small clouds are sailing,
 Blue sky prevailing,
 The rain is over and gone!
