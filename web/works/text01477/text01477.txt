Clair de Lune

Your soul is a sealed garden, and there go
   With masque and bergamasque fair companies
   Playing on lutes and dancing and as though   
Sad under their fantastic fripperies. 

Though they in minor keys go caroling   
Of love the conqueror and of live boon
   They seem to doubt the happiness they sing   
And the song melts into the light of the moon,

The sad light of the moon, so lovely fair   
That all the birds dream in the leafy shade   
And the slim fountains sob into the air   
Among the marble statues in the glade.
