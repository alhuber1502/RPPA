The Hermit of Mount Cenis.

  Romance.

When the stranger, roaming lonely,
reached the summit of Mount Cenis
bright with steep and horrid snow,
on the endless smiling beauty
of th’ Italian spreading plainland
from that peak he gazed below.

His bold step, his fiery glances
made all people doubt no longer
that his every fancy glowed.
And this made the hermits wonder,
who had helped the frightened stranger
through the perils of the road.

One of them, with the resentment
of a man still vexed with sorrow,
breaking the new-comer’s glow,
said: “May he be cursed forever,
who without sad tears approaches
that fair land of grief and woe!”

As one suddenly awakened
by an insult wrongly fallen
on his blameless innocence,
so the stranger turned and stared at
the old hermit of Mount Cenis,
with a lightning in his glance.

But it was a flash. A sudden
tear the venerable pupils
of the hermit came to veil;
and the stranger, moved to pity,
knew that deep within that spirit
lived a long, mysterious tale.

For, one day, to his cold dwelling
mere upon the Baltic billows
news had come from Italy:
of oppressors and of rebels:
of new hopes and of dissentions,
and of battles soon to be.

But confused and quickly fleeting
was the news, for soon a royal
bulletin was issued forth:
“All of Italy was peaceful
and once more she cheered the changeless
thrones with joy and thankful oath.”

And he thought: “No joy can prosper,
for no dwelling-place is merry
if sad weeping’s still outside.”
With a meek and gentle query
he aroused the stranger’s spirit,
who at last to him replied:

“There’s no bliss but only brooding,
there’s no cheer but only silence,
there’s no peace but only fear.
Like the sea on which she stretches,
boundless are Italy’s achings,
and unending her despair.

“For her freedom she unwisely
has believed in princes, trusting
what their oaths do not disclose.
But all princes have betrayed her,
have surrounded her with treason,
and have sold her to her foes.

“From these Alps as far as Scylla
now her law’s the foreign cannon
that once more protects her kings.
From these Alps as far as Scylla
’tis a crime to love our country,
and each sigh new terror beings.

“Done with rags, a restless people
from the Brenner Pass onrushing
down to setze each region ran:
and drew other throngs in silence
where they were accused and sentenced
by the same false, wrathful man.

“Look — the childen of such anguish,
bent upon their hoes, are sweating:
go, and ask their suffering.
‘These two arms,’ they all will tell you,
‘must forever reap this harvest
just to pay a foreign king.’

“Quick, go down, and seek the banners
of the heroes, seek the laurels
that once wreathed Italy’s mind.
All her troops have long been scattered,
and the sages’ lips are silent,
and the just in chains you find.

“Snatched away from shops and furrows,
and from mothers’ tender speeches,
every valiant lad you see
doomed in distant foreign prisons
for the scourge of the vile Teuton
preaching only slavery.

“Find for Italy the rapture
of her children, for a hundred
towns the days that prospered once:
where's the flute that may be bringing
back to mind our happy vigils
and our maidens’ carefree dance?

“Go, and bask in all her sunshine,
breathe her air, enjoy the lively
scent of all her fields in bloom.
But to what avail your singing?
You have none with whom to share it:
fear has sealed each heart as tomb.

“You will see around the fireplace
sons and fathers bound in silence,
and young brides turn pale you’ll see
at the sight of all that grieving,
and then brothers who with envy
think of brothers quick to flee.

“Why, oh, why can I not also
with my grief, among the exiles,
my beloved son now find?
O my son, O my dear Silvio,
oh, what made you think of trusting
your own guiltless heart and mind?

“Oh, the hapless one! They caught him
as a lamb in its enclosure;
from the executioner’s hands
soon perfidious men have snatched him,
that he drink his sorrow’s chalice
ever slowly and in chains,

“where no gentle soul gives comfort,
where his days are only numbered
by the pace of the new guards ...”
At this point a burst of sobbing
from the breast of that poor father
interrupted his sad words.

And the hermit helped him promptly
with his hand and with his solace.
On his breast he clasped that hand;
then like one who more is weeping
as he tries to check his weeping,
up he walked with his new friend.

Ah, what Alp so far and lonely
can his memories now silence,
in his heart hush all the strife
that in desperation stole him
from the old, beloved habits
and the stormy winds of life?

As a promise that a drunkard
makes at table in the evening
and at dawn is soon denied,
so on that Italian border
all desire to see his country
in the stranger’s spirit died.

To her lovely suns and vineyards,
saddened by the bitter weeping
caused by tyrants and by foes,
he preferred the gloomy fir-trees,
and the mists and the unending
stormy seas he gladly chose.
