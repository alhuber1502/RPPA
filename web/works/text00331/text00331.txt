To Harriet

Whose is the love that, gleaming through the world,
 Wards off the poisonous arrow of its scorn? 
Whose is the warm and partial praise,
 Virtueâ€™s most sweet reward? 

Beneath whose looks did my reviving soul
 Riper in truth and virtuous daring grow? 
Whose eyes have I gazed fondly on,
 And loved mankind the more? 

Harriet, on thine! Thou wert my purer mind,
 Thou wert the inspiration of my song;
 Thine are these early wilding flowers,
 Though garlanded by me. 

Then press into thy breast this pledge of love,
 And know (though time may change, and years may roll)
 Each flowret gathered in my heart
 It consecrates to thine.
