I Am No Byron

I am no Byron, not at all,
Of the elect but still unknown.
Like him, world-harried and alone,
A wanderer — with a Russian soul.

I started sooner, soon will die,
A mind more limited in scope.
In me, as in the ocean, lie
Fragmented cargoes, broken hope.

Who can retrieve, O sullen ocean,
The mysteries your fathoms hide?
Who will communicate my passion?
I — or nobody — or a god!
