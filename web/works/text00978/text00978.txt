[Mignon's Song]

Do you know the land where the lemon-trees bloom,
And from dark leaves golden oranges glow,
Where the myrtle is still and the laurel is tall,
And from blue sky gentle breezes blow,
Surely you know it?
There I would go!
There I would go, my beloved, with you.

Do you know the house? Columns hold the roof,
The rooms all shimmer, halls glisten like gold,
And the marble statues all gaze at me:
“What have they done to you, poor little child?”
Surely you know it?
There I would go!
There I would go, my protector, with you.

Do you know the mountain and its path of cloud
Where the mule through the mist must find its way?
In caves there dwells the dragon’s ancient brood,
And down sheer cliffs the rivers roar and spray.
Surely you know it!
I’ll go there with you!
That is our way, Father, there we must go!
