One thought keeps tormenting me ...

One thought keeps tormenting me still: to lie
in bed with pillows round me, and so die!
To waste away piecemeal like a flower
gnawed by some hidden larva hour by hour;
to gutter down like a candle, piecemeal too,
standing in some dreary empty room.
My God, it’s not this death we want to see,
it’s not this death you have stored up for me!
Let me rather be a lightning-conducting tree,
or one the storm attacks, uproots, twists free;
let me be a thunder-battered rock bowled low
from crags and sky in shock to the valley floor ...
Wait till the slave generations are uncharmed,
and tired of chains take to arms,
their faces flushed, their banners red,
and on their banners the slogan spelled
FREEDOM FOR THE WORLD
and the words are called
loudly, they call then from East to West
till tyrants think battle is best:
let it be there I fall
fighting in the field,
let it be there the blood slides out of my heart,
and when the last exultation tears me apart
let my dying words be drowned by ringing steel
and growling of the guns and trumpet-peal,
and let horses whinny
over my body
as they gallop to victory and bound
above me trampled into the ground. —
Let it be there they take up my scattered bones
when the great day of mass burial comes,
and with measured, solemn music of the dead
and black-draped banners lifted up ahead
the heroes are given to their common grave.
Sacred world-freedom, it is you who must grieve!
