Superstition’s Dream

[Ll. 13-68]

That time was come, or seemed as it was come,
 When death no longer makes the grave its home,
 When waking spirits leave their earthly rest
 To mix forever with the damned or blest,
 When years in drowsy thousands counted by
 Then hung on minutes with their destiny,
 When life in terror drops its draining glass
 And all that’s mortal like to shadows pass
 As ’neath approaching tempests sinks the sun,
 When time shall leave eternity begun. 
Life swooned in terror at that hour’s dread birth
 And as in ague, shook the fearful earth,
 And shuddering Nature seemed herself to shun
 While trembling conscience felt the deed was done! 
A gloomy sadness round the sky was cast,
 And clouds seemed hurrying with unusual haste –
 Winds urged them forward like to restless ships,
 And light dim faded with its last eclipse,
 While Agitation turned a straining eye,
 And Hope stood watching like a bird to fly,
 And cringing Nature (like a child in dread)
 Clung to her fading garments till she fled,
 And awful sights began to be revealed
 Which Death’s dark dungeons had so long concealed! 
Each grave its doomsday prisoner resigned,
 And burst in noises like an hollow wind,
 And spirits (mingling with the living then)
 Thrilled fearful voices with the cries of men,
 And, flying furious, grinning deep despair
 Shaped dismal shadows on the troubled air,
 And lightning shot its flashes as they came
 And passing clouds seemed kindling into flame
 And strong, and, stronger came the sulphury smell
 While demons followed in the breath of Hell,
 Grinning in mockery as the doomed complained –
 Losing their pains in seeing others pained! 
Fierce raged destruction sweeping o’er the land
 And the last counted moment seemed at hand;
 As scales near equal hang the earnest eyes
 In doubtful balance which shall fall or rise,
 So in the moment of that crashing blast
 Eyes hearts and hopes paused trembling for the last,
 And sudden thunder-claps with yawing rents
 Gashed the frail garment of the elements
 And bursting whirlwinds, winged in purple flame,
 And lightning’s flash in stronger terrors came
 Burning all life and Nature where they fell
 And leaving earth as desolate as Hell. 
The pleasant hues of fields and woods was past
 And Nature’s beauties had enjoyed their last:
 The coloured flower, the green of field and tree,
 What they had been forever ceased to be;
 Grass shriveled brown in miserable hues
 And showers of fire dried up the hissing dews;
 Leaves crumbled ashes to the air’s hot breath,
 And all awaited universal death.
