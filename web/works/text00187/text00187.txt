To the River Loden

Ah! what a weary race my feet have run
 Since first I trod thy banks with alders crowned,
 And thought my way was all through fairy-ground
 Beneath thy azure sky and golden sun,
 Where first my Muse to lisp her notes begun! 
While pensive Memory traces back the round
 Which fills the varied interval between,
 Much pleasure – more of sorrow – marks the scene. 
Sweet native stream, those skies and suns so pure
 No more return to cheer my evening road! 
Yet still one joy remains: that not obscure,
 Nor useless, all my vacant days have flowed,
 From youth’s gay dawn to manhood’s prime mature –
 Nor with the Muse’s laurel unbestowed.
