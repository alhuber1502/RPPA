Hymn to Liberty

We knew thee of old
 Oh, divinely restored,
 By the light of thine eyes
 And the light of thy Sword

From the graves of our slain
 Shall thy valour prevail
 As we greet thee again -
 Hail, Liberty! Hail! 

Long time didst thou dwell
 Mid the peoples that mourn,
 Awaiting some voice
 That should bid thee return. 

Ah, slow broke the day
 And no man dared call,
 For the shadow of tyranny
 Lay over all:

And we saw thee sad eyed,
 The tears on thy cheeks
 While thy raiment was dyed
 In the blood of the Greeks. 

Yet, behold now thy sons
 With impetuous breath
 Go forth to the fight
 Seeking freedom or Death. 

From the graves of our slain
 Shall thy valour prevail
 As we greet thee again -
 Hail, Liberty! Hail!
