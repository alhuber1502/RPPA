When I am Tired with Life ...

1

When I am tired with life, with the treachery of hope,
 In my soul, I surrender to the battle of despair;
 Day and night, I close my eyes
 And at times, so strangely, my sight returns. 

The darkness of everyday life is darker yet,
 Just as after a bright autumn lightning,
 When, in the sky, like a intimate summons,
 The golden eyelashes of the stars are sparking. 

The infinity of lights is so translucent,
 That the entire chasm of the heavens becomes visible,
 And I look from time straight into eternity
 And recognize your flame, O sun of the world. 

And on fiery roses, motionlessly,
 Smoke rises from this living altar of the universe,,
 In its smoke, as in creative dreams,
 All force is trembling, and all eternity appears in a dream. 

Everything which is rushing through the chasm of the heavens,
 Every ray, corporeal and incorporeal,
 Is only your brightness, O sun of the world,
 But only a dream, a fleeting dream. 

And with the universal breeze of these dreams
 I am rushing like a puff of smoke, and I too fade away,
 And in this recovery of sight, in this oblivion
 It is easy for me to live and painless for me to breathe.

In the silence and dark of the mysterious night
 I see the brilliance, welcoming and dear,
 Amid the chorus of stars, of familiar eyes
 Shining in the steppe above a forgotten grave. 

The grass has withered, the wilderness is somber,
 And the orphaned grave sleeps on alone,
 Only in the sky, like an eternal thought,
 The golden eyelashes of the stars are sparkling. 

And in my dream I see that you have risen from the grave,
 Appearing just as you did when you departed from the world,
 And in my dream we both are young again,
 And you looked at me the way you used to.
