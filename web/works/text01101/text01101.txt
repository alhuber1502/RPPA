Think of It, O Soul!

A fir sapling is growing
Who knows where in the woods.
A rosebush is growing too
In who knows what garden.
Already they’ve been chosen,
Think of it, O Soul,
To be planted on your grave
To take root there and grow.

Two black colts are grazing
On the meadow.
They come back to town
Blithely prancing.
Step by step they’ll go
Pulling your corpse —
Perhaps, perhaps before
The iron comes loose
From their flashing hooves!
