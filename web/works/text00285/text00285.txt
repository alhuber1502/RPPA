For A’ That, and A’ That

Is there, for honest Poverty
 That hings his head, and a’ that? 
The coward-slave, we pass him by,
 We dare be poor for a’ that! 
For a’ that, and a’ that
 (Our toils obscure, and a’ that),
 The rank is but the guinea’s stamp,
 The Man’s the gowd for a’ that! 

What though on hamely fare we dine,
 Wear hoddin grey, and a’ that –
 Gie fools their silks and knaves their wine,
 A man’s a man for a’ that! 
For a’ that, and a’ that,
 Their tinsel show, and a’ that,
 The honest man, though e’er sae poor,
 Is king o’ men for a’ that. 

Ye see yon birkie ca’d a lord,
 Wha struts, and stares, and a’ that,
 Though hundreds worship at his word,
 He’s but a coof for a’ that! 
For a’ that and a’ that
 (His ribband, star, and a’ that),
 The man of independent mind,
 He looks and laughs at a’ that! 

A prince can mak a belted knight –
 A marquis, duke, and a’ that –
 But an honest man’s aboun his might:
 Gude faith, he mauna fa’ that! 
For a’ that, and a’ that
 Their dignities, and a’ that),
 The pith o’ sense, and pride o’ worth,

Are higher rank than a’ that! 
Then let us pray that come it may,
 As come it will for a’ that,
 That sense and worth, o’er a’ the earth
 Shall bear the gree, and a’ that –
 For a’ that, and a’ that,
 Its comin yet for a’ that,
 That man to man, the warld o’er,
 Shall brothers be, for a’ that!
