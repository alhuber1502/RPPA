The Devil’s Thoughts

From his brimstone bed at break of day
 A walking the Devil is gone,
 To visit his snug little farm the Earth,
 And see how his stock went on. 

Over the hill and over the dale,
 And he went over the plain,
 And backward and forward he swished his long tail
 As a gentleman swishes his cane. 

He saw a lawyer killing a viper
 On the dunghill beside his stable;
 ‘Oh, oh!’, quoth he, for it put him in mind
 Of the story of Cain and Abel. 

An apothecary on a white horse
 Rode by on his vocation,
 And the Devil thought of his old friend
 Death in the Revelation. 

He went into a rich bookseller’s shop,
 Quoth he, ‘We are both of one college! 
For I sat myself, like a cormorant, once
 Upon the tree of knowledge.’ 

He saw a turnkey in a trice
 Hand-cuff a troublesome blade;
 ‘Nimbly,’ quoth he, ‘the fingers move
 If a man is but used to his trade.’ 

He saw the same turnkey unfettering a man,
 With but little expedition,
 And he laughed for he thought of the long debates
 On the Slave-trade abolition. 

As he went through [Cold-Bath] fields he looked
 At a solitary cell;
 And the Devil was pleased, for it gave him a hint
 For improving the prisons of Hell. 

He past a cottage with a double coach-house,
 A cottage of gentility;
 And he grinned at the sight, for his favourite vice
 Is pride that apes humility. 

He saw a pig right rapidly
 Adown the river float,
 The pig swam well, but every stroke
 Was cutting his own throat. 

Old Nicholas grinned and swished his tail
 For joy and admiration;
 And he thought of his daughter, Victory,
 And his darling babe, Taxation. 

He met an old acquaintance
 Just by the Methodist meeting –
 She held a consecrated flag,
 And the Devil nods a greeting. 

She tipped him the wink, then frowned and cried,
 ‘Avaunt! my name’s Religion’,
 And turned to Mr. W [ilberforce]
 And leered like a love-sick pigeon. 

General [Gascoigne] ’s burning face
 He saw with consternation,
 And back to Hell his way did take,
 For the Devil thought by a slight mistake
 It was general conflagration.
