Whither?

I heard a brooklet gushing
 From its rocky fountain near,
   Down into the valley rushing,
 So fresh and wondrous clear. 

I know not what came o’er me,
 Nor who the counsel gave;
 But I mult hasten downward,
 All with my pilgrim-stave;

Downward, and ever farther,
 And ever the brook beside;
 And ever fresher murmured. 
And ever clearer, the tide. 

Is this the way I was going? 
Whither, O brooklet, say! 
Thou hast, with thy soft murmur. 
Murmured my senses away. 

What do I say of a murmur? 
That can no murmur be;
 ’T is the water-nymphs, that are singing
   Their roundelays under me. 

Let them sing, my friend, let them murmur,
   And wander merrily near;
 The wheels of a mill are going
 In every brooklet clear.
