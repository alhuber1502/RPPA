To a Distant Scene

Still are the cowslips from thy bosom springing,
 Oh far-off, grassy dell? And dost thou see,
 When southern winds first wake their vernal singing,
 The star-gleam of the wood anemone? 
Doth the shy ring-dove haunt thee yet, the bee
 Hang on thy flowers as when I breathed farewell
 To their wild blooms? And, round my beechen tree,
 Still, in green softness, doth the moss-bank swell? 
Oh, strange illusion! by the fond heart wrought,
 Whose own warm life suffuses Nature’s. 
My being’s tide of many-coloured thought
 Hath passed from thee; and now, rich, leafy place,
 I paint thee oft, scarce consciously, a scene
 Silent, forsaken, dim, shadowed by what hath been.
