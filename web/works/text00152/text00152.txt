The Solitary Reaper

Behold her, single in the field,
 Yon solitary highland lass,
 Reaping and singing by herself –
 Stop here, or gently pass! 
Alone she cuts and binds the grain,
 And sings a melancholy strain:
 Oh listen, for the vale profound
 Is overflowing with the sound! 

No nightingale did ever chant
 So sweetly to reposing bands
 Of travellers in some shady haunt
 Among Arabian sands;
 No sweeter voice was ever heard
 In springtime from the cuckoo-bird,
 Breaking the silence of the seas
 Among the farthest Hebrides. 

Will no one tell me what she sings? 
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
 For old, unhappy, far-off things,
 And battles long ago;
 Or is it some more humble lay,
 Familiar matter of today –
 Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,
 That has been, and may be again? 

Whate’er the theme, the maiden sang
 As if her song could have no ending;
 I saw her singing at her work
 And o’er the sickle bending;
 I listened till I had my fill,
 And as I mounted up the hill
 The music in my heart I bore
 Long after it was heard no more.
