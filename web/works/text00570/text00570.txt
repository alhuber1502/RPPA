When No Longer Numbers and Figures

When no longer numbers and figures
 Are keys to all creatures,
 When those who sing or kiss
 Know more than all the learned scholars,
 When the world returns to itself
 In a life of freedom,
 When once again the light and shadow wed
 And these united give the real clarity,
 When man can know the true world story
 In myths and in the form of poems,
 Then will the whole deformed being
 Vanish before one single secret word.
