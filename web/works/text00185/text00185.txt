Dreams

Surely I heard a voice – surely my name
 Was breathed in tones familiar to my heart? 
I listened, and the low wind stealing came,
 In darkness and in silence to depart. 

Surely I saw a form, a proud bright form,
 Standing beside my couch? I raised mine eyes –
 ’Twas but a dim cloud, herald of a storm,
 That floated through the grey and twilight skies. 

Surely the brightness of the summer-hour
 Hath suddenly burst upon the circling gloom? 
I dream – ’twas but the perfume of a flower,
 Which the breeze wafted through the silent room. 

Surely a hand clasped mine with greetings fond? 
A name is murmured by my lips with pain! 
Woe for that sound – woe for love’s broken bond! 
I start, I wake, I am alone again!
