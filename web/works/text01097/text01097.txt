The Beautiful Beech

Deep in the forest I know of a place that is carefully hidden,
There I found growing a beech fairer than pictures can show.
Smooth is its stem and pure and proudly alone it is rising.
None of its neighbors can touch it in its sericeous dress.
Everywhere underneath the range of the stately tree’s branches
Grows the grass in a ring, pleasant and cool for the eye.
Equally far on all sides it surrounds the stem in the center.
Artless nature itself created this beautiful round.
Delicate bushes at first encircle it like a green wreath.
Beyond them the tall-stemmed trees keep out the heavenly blue.
Next to the darker wealth of the oaktree, the birch gently swaying
Offers her maiden hair shyly to gold-given light.
Only here, where the footpath covered by rocks steeply slants,
Can I, behind the glade, sense the wide-open field.
— Recently, when I walked lonely, losing my path in the bushes,
Tempted and led astray, looking at summer’s new forms,
Suddenly to my surprise here I was led by a genius,
Friendly he was, harkening god of the hallowed grove.
What a delight I felt! The sun was just high in its zenith,
All was still, quiet were even the birds in the leaves.
After a moment’s delay, I stepped on the elegant carpet,
Only quite softly I walked, splendor was meeting my foot.
Then, while I leaned on the stem right under the tree’s arching branches,
(It starts its vault not too high) wandered my eyes in the round
Over the shadowy circle to where the sunbeams were flaming
Forming a dazzling rim equally measured around.
But I stood and I moved not; to the demoniac quiet,
To the unfathomed peace listened my innermost soul.
When I was closed in with you in these sunny and magic surroundings
Nothing I felt and I thought, Solitude!, only you!
