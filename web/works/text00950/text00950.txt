Golden Verses

Man, free thinker! You claim only you can think
While in everything around you life expands?
The forces you control you dispose of as you will,
But the universe is absent from your plans.

Honor the spirit active in each beast;
A soul in touch with nature fills each flower;
In every metal lies a mystery of love.
“Everything is sentient!” You’re in its power.

Beware: the blind wall keeps you in its gaze;
Even to mere matter a word is attached ...
Don't make it serve a purpose not its own!

In obscure things may dwell a hidden God;
And like a nascent eye covered by its lid,
A pure spirit grows beneath the husk of stone!
