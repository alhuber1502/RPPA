The Clod and the Pebble

‘Love seeketh not itself to please,
 Nor for itself hath any care,
 But for another gives its ease,
 And builds a Heaven in Hell’s despair.’ 

So sang a little clod of clay,
 Trodden with the cattle’s feet,
 But a pebble of the brook
 Warbled out these metres meet:

‘Love seeketh only self to please,
 To bind another to its delight –
 Joys in another’s loss of ease,
 And builds a Hell in Heaven’s despite.’
