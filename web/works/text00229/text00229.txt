Give Me the Gloomy Walk

Give me the gloomy walk in summer-time
 That intersects the woods where Nature weaves
 Her bowers at will (that, close-encumbered, climb
 Dark overhead their many-mingling leaves),
 While curious anxiousness the bosom heaves
 The hidden beauties of the shade to find
 That in the negligence of summer lives;
 Each herb, leaf, noting of peculiar kind,
 And many a flower and many a nameless weed,
 Where eye scarce marks ’em ere they’re run to seed –
 And where the mossy stump invites to rest,
 And woodbines up the hazel’s stem proceed,
 Drop down and muse within one’s sheltered nest
 Or from one’s pocket take a book and read.
