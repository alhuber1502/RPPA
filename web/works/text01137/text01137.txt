Setting Suns,

II.

The light flees from heaven. Beneath the sky’s transparent veil
A star ventures out now and then, dim and pale.
The night, step by step, climbs to evening’s throne and fills
Some sky with brown, while some struggles with the dark;
And already, following the sun’s violet arc,
The grey dusk is dying up along the blackened hills.

And over there the city with its starry panes alit,
With its vast cathedral and the steeples under it,
The towers of its palaces and prisons, every wall
And clockface, every tall and sombre fortress too,
Laid out on the skyline like the teeth of a saw —
The city with its thousand roofs cuts the sky in two.

Take me to some high ledge of a tower, like a cliff’s,
From which the town opens up beneath like an abyss!
That I may hear this city through which we make our way
Compose itself or cry out, like a widow, in its pains,
Or groan even louder than the river in the day,
The great river, struggling against the bridges’ chains!

That I may see, coming into view as starry streaks,
The sudden sparks of carriages crossing in the streets,
The people winding through the narrow alleyways,
The smoke dissolve above the chimneys like black foam,
And, gliding onto the façades of blazoned homes,
A hundred lights be born, grow bright, and pass away!

And may the ageing city lie and stretch itself out
In front of me, and may a sigh escape from its mouth
As though a groan of weariness were rising from the street!
May I stand watch alone there on the city’s brow
With all the oceanic noises of the crowd
And look down on the giant sleeping at my feet!
