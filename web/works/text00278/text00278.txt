First Love

Yes, I know that you once were my lover,
 But that sort of thing has an end,
 And though love and its transports are over,
 You know you can still be – my friend:
 I was young, too, and foolish, remember
 (Did you ever hear John Hardy sing?) –
 It was then the fifteenth of November,
 And this is the end of the spring! 

You complain that you are not well-treated
 By my suddenly altering so;
 Can I help it? – you’re very conceited,
 If you think yourself equal to Joe. 
Don’t kneel at my feet, I implore you;
 Don’t write on the drawings you bring;
 Don’t ask me to say, ‘I adore you,’
 For, indeed, it is now no such thing. 

I confess, when at Bognor we parted,
 I swore that I worshipped you then –
 That I was a maid broken-hearted,
 And you the most charming of men. 
I confess, when I read your first letter,
 I blotted your name with a tear –
 But, oh! I was young – knew no better,
 Could I tell that I’d meet Hardy here? 

How dull you are grown! How you worry,
 Repeating my vows to be true –
 If I said so, I told you a story,
 For I love Hardy better than you! 
Yes! my fond heart has fixed on another
 I sigh so whenever he’s gone),
 I shall always love you – as a brother,
 But my heart is John Hardy’s alone.
