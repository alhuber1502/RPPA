Jerusalem

[‘Trembling I Sit’, plate 5, ll. 16 – 20]

Trembling I sit day and night. My friends are astonished at me,
 Yet they forgive my wanderings. I rest not from my great task –
 To open the eternal worlds, to open the immortal eyes
 Of Man inwards into the worlds of thought; into Eternity
 Ever expanding in the bosom of God, the human imagination!
