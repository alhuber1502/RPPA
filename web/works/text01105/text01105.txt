To Leopardi’s Book

There are long sighs that reach across the ages
To teach loye even to the souls of sages.
O wise ones! From however far those sighs, tyill come
Their burning sweetness will one day strikg. you dumb.

And if you must keep within your seclusion
The calm that fosters scholarly immersion,
Do not risk your eyes on the gentle flashes
Of the eternal storm wrapped in those verses,

In those songs, in those cries, in the veiled lament,
Bells that warn of sorrow, always resonant.
Oh! Do not tempt, with a courage foolhardy,
All the love that weeps with Leopardi!

Leopardi! Sweet Christ by father forgotten,
Changed by death without its hoped-for heaven,
Opened with a key hung from every cradle,
Lifting the future’s seal, deemed unliftable.

Enemy of himself alone! To love with no belief!
To feel water on his parched lips but no relief!
Not to breathe in God from the soul of a bloom!
Not'to console his angel’s heart, so filled with gloom.

What the angel suffered from blind and childlike man,
What they said to each other but could not understand,
What each has endured and both struggled at,
Wise ones who want to live, oh! do not learn that!

Oh! Death! True awakening from the reverie!
Liberty! Your reign will not be illusory!
The great unveiling of souls and of light;
It will be God himself ... Oh! In all of love’s might!
