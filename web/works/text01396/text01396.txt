A Crocodile

Hard by the lilied Nile I saw
 A duskish river-dragon stretched along,
 The brown habergeon of his limbs enamelled
 With sanguine almandines and rainy pearl:
 And on his back there lay a young one sleeping,
 No bigger than a mouse; with eyes like beads,
 And a small fragment of its speckled egg
 Remaining on its harmless, pulpy snout;
 A thing to laugh at, as it gaped to catch
 The baulking merry flies. In the iron jaws
 Of the great devil-beast, like a pale soul
 Fluttering in rocky hell, lightsomely flew
 A snowy trochilus, with roseate beak
 Tearing the hairy leeches from his throat.
