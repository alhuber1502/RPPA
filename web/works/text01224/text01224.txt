To Him

In the sweet season
when my youth bloomed,
in that early time,
short sweet primavera
wearing so many flowers,

I remember that day
I wandered slowly
in a shaded forest
and the melancholy
sun fell into place.

My soul — once taken by nature
became agitated with vague feelings
and in that cool hour
fall of enchantment
beneath a flaming sky,

it felt as if the bird
chirping in its nest
and the light that stroked
the grey peak of the mountain
as it softly died,

the zephyr which breathed
on the buds,
and the murmur of thé stream
that played with the cooing
of weeping dove,

and the bleating of the sheep
and the shepherd’s song
and the trembling branches,
all of it spoke to rile of love.

I listened closely
trembling with feeling
and in each throb
I believed my heart
made contact
with a higher being.

And just as suddenly
not like I was dreaming
but loving, burning & alive
he came to me,
the unknown lord of my
soul.

His eyes reflected
the blue of the sky’s loveliness,
not the glowing sky of dawn
but its afternoon, glazed
by a mysterious iridescence.

His body was not Herculaean
but slender like a palm.
He raised this lofty head,
it was illuminated
by his soul’s rapture.

Me, in complete abandon
to the fragrance of his breath
delivered by the wind
and tossed with airs
of balsamic flowers,

I even felt his voice
full of an extravagant sweetness
and in the harmony
the countryside reserves for saying
goodbye to the pure regal light
of the sun.

Oh soul who was he,
that unknown beloved ideal:
a genie? angel, a man?
you know: Him.
Don’t be surprised by his power.

The years flew and I
kept hoping to see this lovely vision,
finally the time came; your shining brow,
it’s him, my heart cried.

And it was right, your dear self,
which my excited soul knew at once
in that happy morning of my life
I saw, and never forgot.

My first sweet sigh was yours;
you are my constant secret desire,
a destiny fiercely revealed
then fallen among the waves of the sea.

Looking for a world that he found in dreams,
brave Columbus once plowed them
for you — the world and the dream in my soul.
I have also crossed a great expanse.

The mariner’s compass is not so exact
when choosing the star that guides him
as mine was in marking the road
to discover the North Star of my life.

In my country there is a serpent
that has awful power over birds;
it shoots fire with a look
and they fall right into its mouth,

and who has not watched a moth
chase the flame that will consume him
or watched a spring hurrying,
tunning to lose itself, silently, in the sea.

O Power that sweeps me away, be my flame,
Will you be my ocean, my serpent?
Does it matter? My heart accepts you and loves you,
whether it's death or life that awaits.

To a leaf that a strong breeze carries away
what would it serve to ask for its route?
If it’s lifted to the clouds or down in the dumps,
flying, or blowing apart, it follows.
