Pantisocracy

No more my visionary soul shall dwell
 On joys that were! No more endure to weigh
 The shame and anguish of the evil day,
 Wisely forgetful! Oâ€™er the ocean swell
 Sublime of hope I seek the cottaged dell,
 Where virtue calm with careless step may stray,
 And dancing to the moonlight roundelay
 The wizard passions weave an holy spell. 
Eyes that have ached with sorrow! Ye shall weep
 Tears of doubt-mingled joy, like theirs who start
 From precipices of distempered sleep
 On which the fierce-eyed fiends their revels keep,
 And see the rising sun, and feel it dart
 New rays of pleasance trembling to the heart.
