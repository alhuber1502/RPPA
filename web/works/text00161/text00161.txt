The Maid of Athens

Maid of Athens, ere we part,
 Give, oh give me back, my heart! 
Or, since that has left my breast,
 Keep it now – and take the rest! 
Hear my vow, before I go:
 My life, I love you. 

By those tresses unconfined,
 Wooed by each Aegean wind;
 By those lids whose jetty fringe
 Kiss thy soft cheeks’ blooming tinge;
 By those wild eyes like the roe –
 My life, I love you. 

By that lip I long to taste;
 By that zone-encircled waist;
 By all the token-flowers that tell
 What words can never speak so well;
 By love’s alternate joy and woe –
 My life, I love you. 

Maid of Athens, I am gone! 
Think of me, sweet, when alone –
 Though I fly to Istamboul,
 Athens holds my heart and soul! 
Can I cease to love thee? No!
 My life, I love you.
