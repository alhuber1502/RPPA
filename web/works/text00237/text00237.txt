The Castle of Chillon

Fair lake, thy lovely and thy haunted shore
 Hath only echoes for the poet’s lute;
 None may tread there save with unsandalled foot,
 Submissive to the great who went before,
 Filled with the mighty memories of yore. 
And yet how mournful are the records there –
 Captivity, and exile, and despair,
 Did they endure who now endure no more. 
The patriot, the woman, and the bard,
 Whose names thy winds and waters bear along;
 What did the world bestow for their reward
 But suffering, sorrow, bitterness, and wrong? 
Genius, a hard and weary lot is thine –
 Thy heart thy fuel, and the grave thy shrine.
