Advice Gratis to Certain Women

By a Woman

O, my strong-minded sisters, aspiring to vote,
And to row with your brothers, all in the same boat,
When you come out to speak to the public your mind,
Leave your tricks, and your airs, and your graces behind!

For instance, when you by the world would be seen
As reporter, or editor (first-class, I mean),
I think — just to come to the point in one line —
What you write will be finer, if ’tis not too fine.

Pray, don’t let the thread of your subject be strung
With “golden,” and “shimmer,” “sweet,” “filter,” and “flung;”
Nor compel, by your style, all your readers to guess
You’ve been looking up words Webster marks obs. 

And another thing: whatever else you may say,
Do keep personalities out of the way;
Don’t try every sentence to make people see
What a dear, charming creature the writer must be!

Leave out affectations and pretty appeals;
Don’t “drag yourself in by the neck and the heels,”
Your dear little boots, and your gloves; and take heed,
Nor pull your curls over men’s eyes while they read.

Don’t mistake me; I mean that the public’s not home,
You must do as the Romans do, when you’re in Rome;
I would have you be womanly, while you are wise;
’Tis the weak and the womanish tricks I despise.

On the other hand: don’t write and dress in such styles
As astonish the natives, and frighten the isles;
Do look, on the platform, so folks in the show
Needn’t ask, “Which are lions, and which tigers?” you know!

’Tis a good thing to write, and to rule in the state,
But to be a true, womanly woman is great:
And if ever you come to be that, ’twill be when
You can cease to be babies, nor try to be men!
