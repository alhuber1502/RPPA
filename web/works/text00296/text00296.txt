The Prelude

[Book IX. ‘Residence in France’, ll. 127-168 (Among Royalists: Blois, Spring 1792)]

A knot of military officers
 That to a regiment appertained which then
 Was stationed in the city were the chief
 Of my associates; some of these wore swords
 Which had been seasoned in the wars, and all
 Were men well-born – at least, laid claim to such
 Distinction, as the chivalry of France. 
In age and temper differing, they had yet
 One spirit ruling in them all – alike
 (Save only one, hereafter to be named)
 Were bent upon undoing what was done! 
This was their rest, and only hope; therewith
 No fear had they of bad becoming worse,
 For worst to them had come – nor would have stirred,
 Or deemed it worth a moment’s while to stir,
 In any thing, save only if the act
 Looked thitherward. One, reckoning by years,
 Was in the prime of manhood, and erewhile
 He had sat lord in many tender hearts,
 Though heedless of such honours now, and changed:
 His temper was quite mastered by the times,
 And they had blighted him, had eat away
 The beauty of his person, doing wrong
 Alike to body and to mind. His port,
 Which once had been erect and open, now
 Was stooping and contracted, and a face
 By nature lovely in itself, expressed,
 As much as any that was ever seen,
 A ravage out of season, made by thoughts
 Unhealthy and vexatious. At the hour,
 The most important of each day, in which
 The public news was read, the fever came,
 A punctual visitant, to shake this man,
 Disarmed his voice and fanned his yellow cheek
 Into a thousand colours, While he read,
 Or mused, his sword was haunted by his touch
 Continually, like an uneasy place
 In his own body. ’Twas in truth an hour
 Of universal ferment – mildest men
 Were agitated, and commotions, strife
 Of passions and opinion, filled the walls
 Of peaceful houses with unquiet sounds!
