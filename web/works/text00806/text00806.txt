[263 "A single Screw of Flesh"]

A single Screw of Flesh
Is all that pins the Soul
That stands for Deity, to Mine,
Upon my side the Veil —

Once witnessed of the Gauze —
Its name is put away
As far from mine, as if no plight
Had printed yesterday,

In tender — solemn Alphabet,
My eyes just turned to see,
When it was smuggled by my sight
Into Eternity —

More Hands — to hold — These are but Two —
One more new-mailed Nerve
Just granted, for the Peril’s sake —
Some striding — Giant — Love —

So greater than the Gods can show,
They slink before the Clay,
That not for all their Heaven can boast
Will let its Keepsake — go
