Sappho and Phaon

[Sonnet XXV. — To Phaon]

Canst thou forget, oh idol of my soul,
 Thy Sappho’s voice, her form, her dulcet lyre
 That melting every thought to fond desire
 Bade sweet delirium o’er thy senses roll? 
Canst thou so soon renounce the blest control
 That calmed with pity’s tears love’s raging fire,
 While hope, slow breathing on the trembling wire,
 In every note with soft persuasion stole? 
Oh, sovereign of my heart – return, return! 
For me no spring appears, no summers bloom,
 No sun-beams glitter, and no altars burn! 
The mind’s dark winter of eternal gloom
 Shows midst the waste a solitary urn,
 A blighted laurel, and a mouldering tomb!
