The Norwegian

Between cliffs and the billowing breakers
 The Norwegian of old found his home
 A foundation he laid in these acres
 His own hands raised his house from the loam. 

He looked out on the boulder-strewn beaches,
 Not a settlement was there in sight. 
‘Let’s build farms and clear fields in these reaches,
 Thus we win them to be ours by right.’ 

He saw seas that the storm tore asunder
 The rough waves made them risky to row
 Yet the fish had their passage thereunder,
 And their ways he was eager to know. 

In the winter he might fall to pining:
 ‘That I were in a sunnier part!’ 
But when sun in the springtime was shining
 Then his homeland grew dear to his heart. 

And when fields are like gardens in May-time,
 When each hillside is leafy and green,
 And when midnight grows light like in daytime
 Nowhere else has such beauty he seen.
