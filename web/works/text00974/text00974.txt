Prometheus

Darken your heavens, Zeus,
With clouds of mist,
And like a boy beheading thistles
Try your skill
Against oaks and mountaintops.
My earth you must still
Leave standing for me,
And my hut, which you did not build,
And my hearth
Whose warmth
You envy me.

I know of nothing under the sun, Gods,
More miserable than you!
You wretchedly feed
Your majesty
On burnt offerings
And prayer-breath,
And you’d starve
If children and beggars
Weren’t hope-filled fools.

When I was a child
Not knowing my way about,
I turned my ignorant eye
To the sun, as if there were an ear
Up there to hear my complaints,
A heart like mine
To take pity on the afflicted.

Who helped me
Against the hubris of the Titans?
Who saved me from death,
From slavery?
Didn’t you bring all this about yourself,
Holy glowing heart?
And, young and good and hoodwinked,
Didn’t you glow your thanks for salvation
To that sleeper up above?

I should honor you? What for?
Did you ever relieve the pains
Of the burdened?
Did you ever quiet the tears
Of the fearful?
Wasn’t I forged into manhood
By almighty time
And eternal fate
My masters, and yours?

Did you believe, perhaps,
I would hate life
And flee to the wild
Because not all
Budding dreams ripened?

Here I sit, making men
In my image,
A race that shall be like me,
To suffer, to weep,
To take pleasure, to feel joy,
And to neglect you
As I do!
