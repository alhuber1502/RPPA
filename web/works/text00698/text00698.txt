Ah! Woman Still

Ah! woman still
Must veil the shrine,
Where feeling feeds the fire divine,
Nor sing at will,
Untaught by art,
The music prison’d in her heart!

Still gay the note,
And light the lay,
The woodbird warbles on the spray,
Afar to float;
But homeward flown,
Within his nest, how changed the tone!

Oh! none can know,
Who have not heard
The music-soul thrills the bird,
The carol low
As coo of dove
He warbles to his woodland-love!

The world would say
’Twas vain and wild,
The impassion’d lay of Nature’s child;
And Feeling so
Should veil the shrine
Where softly glow her fires divine!
