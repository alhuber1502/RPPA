Written in Keats’ ‘Endymion’

I saw pale Dian, sitting by the brink
 Of silver falls, the overflow of fountains
 From cloudy steeps; and I grew sad to think
 Endymion’s foot was silent on those mountains,
 And he but a hushed name, that Silence keeps
 In dear remembrance – lonely, and forlorn,
 Singing it to herself until she weeps
 Tears that perchance still glisten in the morn! 
And as I mused, in dull imaginings,
 There came a flash of garments, and I knew
 The awful Muse by her harmonious wings
 Charming the air to music as she flew. 
Anon there rose an echo through the vale
 Gave back Endymion in a dreamlike tale!
