Suddenly, some day, the prolific artist
Feels the increasing years weigh on his brow;
He wakes and thinks, “How little time is left me!
Those golden days of youth — I’ve spent them all!
As a weeping prodigal sees the depths of his cashbox,
Now I can see the very depths of fate!”
He feels his head bow down, as flowers at midday
Bow down beneath the sun’s more fiery heat;
If, following his allotted path, he happens
To find the grass moist underneath his feet,
He murmurs, knowing that his dawn has vanished,
“It’s only rain, alas; it isn’t déw!”

The die is cast. His genius is riper;
His wings may perhaps fly to prouder peaks;
The smoke shed by his fireside is more rarefied;
His bright star, in the heights, raises less mist;
His stallion triumphs in the field of combat —
But the fresh charm of early youth is gone;
He can no longer lavish it abundantly
On art works crowned with elegance and love!

Nothing can ever bring that back! Whenever
He roams in search of the stray wayside thoughts
That make an artist return home at evening
With a higher head and a prouder heart,
Whenever he goes out to dream, and wanders
Across the satin gauze of glossy fields,
Or through the woods teeming with resonant music
Sung by the little birds to the new dawn,
Or in the noise and bustle of the crossroad
(Paris and crowds possess their beauty too,
Wayfarers after dark on the embankment
Are merely flickering lights that ebb and flow),
Constantly, in his mind, in the depths, even
When art grips him, enthralls him, smiles on him,
Even in song, even when he is thinking
His most joyously nursed and nurtured thoughts,
He feels a pang of desolate cold yearning
For the dead past; — whatever it has been!
