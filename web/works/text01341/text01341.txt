Fate, give me space ...

Fate, give me space to breathe, let me do
something for mankind’s sake!
Never let this fine flame burning in me
die with its useless ache.

A flame is in my heart, a flame from heaven
that burns each drop of blood;
and each beat of my heart becomes a prayer
for the happiness of the world.

If I could only say all this with actions
when words are empty forms!
Even if my actions win me at last
new cross and crown of thorns!

To die for all men’s good would be a death
most happy and most fair!
Fairer and happier than all the raptures
wasted on living air.

Tell me, tell me, fate, such holy death,
awaits me ... and I’ll make
with my own hands the cross on which I’m laid
crucified, to break.
