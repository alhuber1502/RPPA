Tempest

The storm is howling, and the yawning sea
clatters and roars, and the black breakers race
to storm the sky
belabouring with fierce foam the cliff-clad land.

Whose is the hostile power,
whose the capricious hand
that massed the thundering clouds
and raised foul weather in the courts of heaven?
Who, overturning nature’s balance,
drives watery mountains on the shore?
Is it that evil spirit, lord of torment,
who poured out sorrow on the universe,
subordinating human souls
to want and weakness, passion and destruction,
and set against creation all the powers
that had been given to creation?
Before him the earth shakes.
He veils the sky with his gigantic wings
and rules the roaring, rushing waves
with his unruly majesty.

When will it come, the longed-for moment?
When shall I sail out on your waters, ocean?
No, it is not the beauty of far places
that has enchanted my imagination.
I do not hope to find a kinder fate
under some kinder sky.
My soul will not flower again
in some flower-enchanted land.
But let me not await my end
from fate's caprice or life’s slow pain
in slavish quietness
Death is more pleasing to our human pride
among the frenzied waves, facing their rage!
As in the dawn of youth
I thirsted for youth’s joys,
now, ocean, I am thirsty for your tempests.

Swirl and rise up against the rocky shores;
your fearful untamed roar gladdens my ears,
a summons to a long-awaited war,
or a great enemy’s strangely flattering anger.
