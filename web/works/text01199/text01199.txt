The War of 1793

Dark, dark is the night, now it wholly
Covers my native hillock; alone
The tiny stream flees away weeping
Within the green-leaved secret valley.
A song like the murmuring of the brook
Shall I sing; from these boughs a thin
Moonbeam through pallid wisps
Of hair reaches me, falls on my lyre:
Sad is the beam, sad as I now feel
My whole soul to be. A baleful cloud
Covers my country’s fate. Ah me! silent,
Abandoned stand paternal walls
Bereft of sons; always, always at my side
Is Melancholy, sacred to the heart of poets,
Sublime mother of images born
Deep within the breast. Unknown, I am
Virgin still upon the Alps; the age of song
Has barely risen within me. One day I shall be
The Alps’ noble bard, and noble verses from my lyre
Heroes shall hear: only to arouse pity
Now sing I, an unknown maiden
Dwelling among wild mountains.
