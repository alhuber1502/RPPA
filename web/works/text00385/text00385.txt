False Poets and True

Look how the lark soars upward and is gone,
 Turning a spirit as he nears the sky
 His voice is heard, but body there is none
 To fix the vague excursions of the eye. 
So poets’ songs are with us though they die
 Obscured and hid by death’s oblivious shroud,
 And Earth inherits the rich melody
 Like raining music from the morning cloud. 
Yet, few there be who pipe so sweet and loud
 Their voices reach us through the lapse of space. 
The noisy day is deafened by a crowd
 Of undistinguished birds, a twittering race –
 But only lark and nightingale forlorn
 Fill up the silences of night and morn.
