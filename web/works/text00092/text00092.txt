Remembrance of Nature

Oh Nature thou didst rear me for thine own,
 With thy free singing-birds and mountain-brooks,
 Feeding my thoughts in primrose-haunted nooks
 With fairy fantasies and wood-dreams lone;
 And thou didst teach me every wandering tone
 Drawn from thy many-whispering trees and waves,
 And guide my steps to founts and sparry caves,
 And where bright mosses wove thee a rich throne
 Midst the green hills. And now that, far estranged
 From all sweet sounds and odours of thy breath,
 Fading I lie, within my heart unchanged
 So glows the love of thee that not for death
 Seems that pure passionâ€™s fervour, but ordained
 To meet on brighter shores thy majesty unstained.
