I see thee in a thousand pictures

I see thee in a thousand pictures,
Mary, lovingly portrayed;
But none of all can yet reveal thee
As to jnjy soul thou art displayed.

I only know that earthly striving
Blows like a dream away from me,
And heaven sweet beyond describing
Dwells in my soul eternally.
