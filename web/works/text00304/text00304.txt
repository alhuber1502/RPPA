Napoleon’s Farewell

Farewell to the land where the gloom of my glory
 Arose and o’ershadowed the Earth with her name –
 She abandons me now, but the page of her story,
 The brightest, or blackest, is filled with my fame! 

I have warred with a world which vanquished me only
 When the meteor of conquest allured me too far;
 I have coped with the nations which dread me, thus lonely,
 The last single captive to millions in war! 

Farewell to thee, France! When thy diadem crowned me,
 I made thee the gem and the wonder of Earth,
 But thy weakness decrees I should leave as I found thee,
 Decayed in thy glory, and sunk in thy worth. 

Farewell to thee, France! But when Liberty rallies
 Once more in thy regions, remember me then! 
The violet still grows in the depth of thy valleys –
 Though withered, thy tears will unfold it again. 

Yet yet, I may baffle the hosts that surround us,
 And yet may thy heart leap awake to my voice –
 There are links which must break in the chain that has bound us,
 Then turn thee and call on the Chief of thy choice!
