In Egypt’s Sandy Silence

In Egypt’s sandy silence, all alone,
 Stands a gigantic leg, which far off throws
 The only shadows that the desert knows. 
‘I am great Ozymandias’, saith the stone,
 ‘The King of Kings – This mighty city shows
 The wonders of my hand!’ The city’s gone,
 Nought but the leg remaining to disclose
 The site of this forgotten Babylon. 
We wonder, and some hunter may express
 Wonder like ours, when through the wilderness
 Where London stood, holding the wolf in chase,
 He meets some fragment huge, and stops to guess
 What powerful but unrecorded race
 Once dwelt in that annihilated place.
