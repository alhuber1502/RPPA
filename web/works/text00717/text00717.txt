The Prayer

Wilt Thou not visit me?
The plant beside me feels thy gentle dew;
And every blade of grass I see,
From thy deep earth its quickening moisture drew.

Wilt Thou not visit me?
Thy morning calls on me with cheering tone;
And every hill and tree
Lend but one voice, the voice of Thee alone.

Come, for I need thy love;
More than the flower the dew, or grass the rain,
Come, gently as thy holy dove;
And let me in thy sight rejoice to live again.

I will not hide from them,
When thy storms come, though fierce may be their wrath;
But bow with leafy stem,
And strengthened follow on thy chosen path.

Yes, Thou wilt visit me:
Nor plant nor tree thy parent eye delight so well;
As when from sin set free
My spirit loves with thine in peace to dwell.
