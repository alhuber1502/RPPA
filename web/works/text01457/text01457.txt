Old Loves

Louise, have you forgotten yet
   The corner of the flowery land,
 The ancient garden where we met,
 My hand that trembled in your hand? 
Our lips found words scarce sweet enough,
 As low beneath the willow treès
   We sat; have you forgotten, love? 
Do you remember, love Louise? 

Marie, have you forgotten yet
 The loving barter that we made? 
The rings we changed, the suns that set. 
The woods fulfilled with sun and shade?
   The fountains that were musical   
By many an ancient trysting tree —
 Marie, have you forgotten all? 
Do you remember, love Marie? 

Christine, do you remember yet
 Your room with scents and roses gay? 
My garret — near the sky ’twas set —
 The April hours, the nights of May? 
The clear calm nights — the stars above   
That whispered they were fairest seen
   Through no cloud-veil? Remember, love. 
Do you remember, love Christine? 

Louise is dead, and, well-a-day. 
Marie a sadder path has ta’en;
 And pale Christine has passed away   
In southern suns to bloom again. 
Alas, for one and all of us —
 Marie, Louise, Christine forget;
 Our bower of love is ruinous,
 And I alone remember yet.
