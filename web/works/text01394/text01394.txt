Kalevala

[In the Beginning]

I have a good mind
 take into my head
 to start off singing
 begin reciting
 reeling off a tale of kin
 and singing a tale of kind. 
The words unfreeze in my mouth
 and the phrases are tumbling
 upon my tongue they scramble
 along my teeth they scatter. 
Brother dear, little brother
 fair one who grew up with me
 start off now singing with me
 begin reciting with me
 since we have got together
 since we have come from two ways! 
We seldom get together
 and meet each other
 on these poor borders
 the luckless lands of the North. 

Let’s strike hand to hand
 fingers into finger-gaps
 that we may sing some good things
 set some of the best things forth
 for those darling ones to hear
 for those with a mind to know
 among the youngsters rising
 among the people growing —
 those words we have got
 tales we have kindled
 from old Väinämöinen’s belt
 up from Ilmarinen’s forge
 from the tip of Farmind’s brand
 from the path of Joukahainen’s bow
 from the North’s furthest fields, from
 the heaths of Kalevala. 

My father used to sing them
 as he cut an axe handle;
 my mother taught them
 turning her distaff
 and I a child on the floor
 fidgeting before her knee
 a milk-bearded scamp
 a curd-mouthed toddler. 
The Sampo did not lack words
 nor did Louhi spells:
 the Sampo grew old with words
 and Louhi was lost with spells
 and with tales Vipunen died
 and Lemminkäinen with games. 
There are yet other words too
 and mysteries learned —
 snatched from the roadside
 plucked from the heather
 torn from the brushwood
 tugged from the saplings
 rubbed from a grass-head
 ripped from a footpath
 as I went herding
 as a child in the pastures
 on the honey-sweet hummocks
 on the golden knolls
 following black Buttercup
 beside Bouncy the brindled. 
The cold told a tale to me
 the rain suggested poems:
 another tale the winds brought
 the sea’s billows drove;
 the birds added words
 the treetops phrases. 
I wound them into a ball
 and arranged them in a coil
 slipped the ball into my sled
 and the coil into my sledge;
 I took it home in the sled
 in the sledge towards the kiln
 put it up in the shed loft
 in a little copper box. 

Long my tale’s been in the cold
 for ages has lain hidden:
 shall I take the tales out of the cold
 scoop the songs out of the frost
 bring my little box indoors
 the casket to the seat end
 under the famous roof beam
 under the fair roof
 shall I open the word-chest
 and unlock the box of tales
 unwind the top of the ball
 untie the knot of the coil? 
I will sing quite a good tale
 quite a fair one I’ll beat out
 after some rye bread
 and some barley beer. 
If beer is not brought
 and ale not offered
 I’ll sing from a leaner mouth
 after water I will lilt
 to cheer this evening of ours
 to honour the famous day
 or to amuse the morrow
 and to start the new morning. 

I heard it recited thus
 I knew how the tale was made:
 with us the nights come alone
 the days dawn alone, so was
 Väinämöinen born alone
 the eternal bard appeared
 from the woman who bore him
 from Air-daughter his mother. 

There was a lass, an air-girl
 a nice nature-daughter: she
 long remained holy
 for ever girlish
 in the air’s long yards
 on its level grounds. 
Her times grew weary
 and her life felt strange
 from being always alone
 living as a lass
 in the air’s long yards
 in the empty wastes. 
So now she steps further down
 launched herself upon the waves
 on the clear high seas
 upon the open expanse. 
There came a great gust of wind
 from the east nasty weather
 lashed the sea to foam
 whipped it into waves. 
The wind lulled the maid
 and the billow drove the lass
 about the blue main
 and the froth-capped waves;
 and the wind blew her womb full
 the sea makes her fat. 

She bore a hard womb
 a difficult bellyful
 seven hundred years
 nine ages of man;
 but no birth was born
 no creature was created. 
The lass rolled as the water-mother:
 she swims east, swims west
 swims north-west and south
 swims all the skylines
 in fiery birth-pangs
 in hard belly-woes;
 but no birth was born
 no creature was created. 
She weeps and whimpers;
 she uttered a word, spoke thus:
 “Woe, luckless me, for my days
 poor child, for my way of life:
 now I have come to something —
 for ever under the sky
 by the wind to be
 lulled, by billows driven
 on these wide waters
 upon these vast waves! 
Better ’twould have been
 to live as lass of the air
 than just now to toss about
 as water-mother: it is
 chilly for me to be here
 woeful for me to shiver
 in billows for me to dwell
 in the water to wallow. 
O Old Man, chief god
 upholder of all the sky
 come here when you are needed
 come this way when you are called:
 free a wench from a tight spot
 a woman from belly-throes;
 come quickly, arrive promptly
 most promptly where the need is!” 

A little time passed
 a moment sped by. 
Came a scaup, straightforward bird
 and it flaps about
 in search of a nesting-place
 working out somewhere to live. 
It flew east, flew west
 flew north-west and south
 but it finds no room
 not even the worst spot where
 it might build its nest
 take up residence. 
It glides, it hovers
 it thinks, considers:
 “Shall I build my cabin on the wind
 my dwelling on the billows? 
The wind will fell the cabin
 the billow will bear off my dwelling.” 

So then the water-mother
 the water-mother, air-lass
 raised her knee out of the sea
 her shoulderblade from the wave
 for the scaup a nesting-place
 sweet land to live on. 
That scaup, pretty bird
 glides and hovers; it
 spied the water-mother’s knee
 on the bluish main;
 thought it was a grass hummock
 a clump of fresh sward. 
It flutters, it glides
 and it lands on the kneecap. 
There it builds its nest
 laid its golden eggs:
 six eggs were of gold
 an iron egg the seventh. 

It began to hatch the eggs
 to warm the kneecap:
 it hatched one day, it hatched two
 soon it hatched a third as well. 
At that the water-mother
 the water-mother, air-lass
 feels that she is catching fire
 that her skin is smouldering;
 she thought her knee was ablaze
 all her sinews were melting. 
And she jerked her knee
 and she shook her limbs:
 the eggs rolled in the water
 sink into the sea’s billow;
 the eggs smashed to bits
 broke into pieces. 
The eggs don’t fall in the mud
 the fragments in the water. 
The bits changed into good things
 the pieces into fair things:
 an egg’s lower half
 became mother earth below
 an egg’s upper half
 became heaven above;
 the upper half that was yolk
 became the sun for shining
 the upper half that was white
 became the moon for gleaming;
 what in an egg was mottled
 became the stars in the sky
 what in an egg was blackish
 became the clouds of the air.
