To the Unhappy Memory of the Young Author Don Mariano José de Larra

That faint alarm torn by the wind that blows
is the funereal tolling of a bell,
its tones an empty mimicry of those
final laments of a pale corpse that goes
down to the dusty earth where he must dwell.

Having completed all his tasks on earth,
he put aside his life, his earthly traces,
as when some consecrated virgin places
her bridal wreath before the altar rail.

He looked ahead, and saw the void to come,
void, even then, of all its hopeful gleaming,
gave himself to oblivion, with no dreaming,
from which we waken to another vale!

He was a flower that in midsummer withered,
he was a spring that summer dried to dust:
his murmuring is stilled in the brown crust,
and burned by drought the early blossom’s stem.

And still his fragrance lingers in the sense,
and the green radiance of the open field,
that shawl of grass and freshness, all revealed
as offspring of the stream that fathered them.

For the poet, in his progressing
through the earth on which he lives,
is an ill-starred tree that gives
birth to the harvest of blessing.

Sleep in peace in your solitary tomb,
and there may nothing reach your cloistered ear
but this sad prayer for you, whose mournful gloom
a fellow poet turns to melody.

His shall be the most loving tribute, mild,
more pleasing, yes, than that of any man,
pure as the artless weeping of a child,
in memory of the poet lost to me!

If heaven provides on high
a mansion where poets go,
and on this earth where we die
only ice-cold fictions lie

destined to, decay below,
then the body’s well designed
as our departing largesse
to life, bitter and unkind!
Oh, to flee this wilderness,
with rotting flesh left behind!

Poet, if "to be no more"
preserves something from before —
a life like the life we knew
beyond the heaven we see —
there vouchsafe one thought to me,
like the one I’ve kept for you.
