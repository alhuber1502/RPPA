Sappho and Phaon

[Sonnet XXIV. — Her Address to the Moon]

Oh thou, meek orb, that stealing o’er the dale
 Cheerest with thy modest beams the noon of night,
 On the smooth lake diffusing silvery light,
 Sublimely still, and beautifully pale! 
What can thy cool and placid eye avail,
 Where fierce despair absorbs the mental sight,
 While inbred glooms the vagrant thoughts invite
 To tempt the gulf where howling fiends assail? 
Oh Night, all nature owns thy tempered power,
 Thy solemn pause, thy dews, thy pensive beam;
 Thy sweet breath whispering in the moonlight bower
 While fainting flowerets kiss the wandering stream! 
Yet, vain is every charm, and vain the hour,
 That brings to madding love no soothing dream!
