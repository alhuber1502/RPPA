The Thicket

Cool and soft the air blows
Through darkening fields,
And only heaven smiles
Through thousands of bright eyes.

One soul alone is active
In the roaring of the seas,
And in the gentle words
That rustle through the leaves.

So waves resound in waves
Where in secret spirits grieve;
So words respond to word
Where by spirits life is breathed.

One soft sound through every sound
Of earthâ€™s bright-colored dream
Sustains its sound for him alone
Who secretly gives heed.
