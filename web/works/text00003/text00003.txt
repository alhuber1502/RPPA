A London Summer Morning

Who has not waked to list the busy sounds
 Of summer morning in the sultry smoke
 Of noisy London? On the pavement hot
 The sooty chimney-boy, with dingy face
 And tattered covering, shrilly hawks his trade,
 Rousing the sleepy housemaid. At the door
 The milk-pail rattles, and the tinkling bell
 Proclaims the dustman’s office, while the street
 Is lost in clouds impervious. Now begins
 The din of hackney coaches, wagons, carts;
 While tin-men’s shops, and noisy trunk-makers,
 Knife-grinders, coopers, squealing cork-cutters,
 Fruit-barrows, and the hunger-giving cries
 Of vegetable vendors, fill the air. 
Now every shop displays its varied trade,
 And the fresh-sprinkled pavement cools the feet
 Of early walkers. At the private door
 The ruddy housemaid twirls the busy mop,
 Annoying the smart ’prentice, or neat girl
 Tripping with bandbox lightly. Now the sun
 Darts burning splendour on the glittering pane,
 Save where the canvas awning throws a shade
 On the gay merchandise. Now spruce and trim
 In shops where beauty smiles with industry,
 Sits the smart damsel, while the passenger
 Peeps through the window, watching every charm. 
Now pastry dainties catch the eyes minute
 Of hummy insects, while the slimy snare
 Waits to enthral them. Now the lamp-lighter
 Mounts the slight ladder, nimbly venturous,
 To trim the half-filled lamp, while at his feet
 The pot-boy yells discordant. All along
 The sultry pavement, the old-clothes man cries
 In tone monotonous, and sidelong views
 The area for his traffic. Now the bag
 Is slily opened, and the half-worn suit
 (Sometimes the pilfered treasure of the base
 Domestic spoiler) for one half its worth
 Sinks in the green abyss. The porter now
 Bears his huge load along the burning way,
 And the poor poet wakes from busy dreams
 To paint the summer morning.
