To Evening

Perhaps you are so dear to me because
You are the image of that final quiet,
O evening! Both when the gentle winds
And summer clouds escort you gladly,

And when from snowy skies you bring long
And unquiet shadows to the world,
You always come as one my heart invokes:
To its secret ways you enter sweetly in.

You make me wander in my thoughts on paths
Leading to eternal nothing; and meanwhile
This evil time flies, and with it goes the swarm

Of cares with which it wastes itself and me;
And while I look upon your peace, sleep
Comes to my raging warrior soul.
