At Dawn Tomorrow ...

At dawn tomorrow, when the land turns white,
Til leave, because I know you wait for me.
Til go through forests, up the mountain’s height.
I cannot stay away from you. I'll see

Nothing, my eyes fixed on my thoughts, alone,
And hear nothing, not a single sound or sight.
With my back bent, hands crossed, Til walk, unknown,
Sad, and day for me will be like night.

I will not see the golden end of day,
Nor sails descend to Harfleur far away.
When I arrive, Til put this on your tomb —
A bunch of holly sprigs, heather in bloom.
