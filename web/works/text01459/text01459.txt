Il Pleut Doucement sur la Ville

Tears fall within mine heart,
 As rain upon the town:
 Whence does this languor start,
 Possessing all mine heart? 

O sweet fall of the rain   
Upon the earth and roof. 
Unto an heart in pain,
 O music of the rain. 

Tears that have no reason   
Fall in my sorry heart:
 What, there was no treason? 
This grief hath no reason. 

Nay, the more desolate,
 Because, I know not why,
 (Neither for love nor hate)
 Mine heart is desolate.
