To a Brook Near the Village of Corston

As thus I bend me o’er thy babbling stream
 And watch thy current, Memory’s hand portrays
 The faint-formed scenes of the departed days,
 Like the far forest by the moon’s pale beam
 Dimly descried, yet lovely. I have worn
 Upon thy banks the live-long hour away
 When sportive childhood wantoned through the day,
 Joyed at the opening splendour of the morn,
 Or, as the twilight darkened, heaved the sigh
 Thinking of distant home, as down my cheek
 (At the fond thought slow stealing on) would speak
 The silent eloquence of the full eye. 
Dim are the long-past days, yet still they please
 As thy soft sounds, half-heard, borne on the inconstant breeze.
