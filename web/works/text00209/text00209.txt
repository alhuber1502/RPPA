The World Is Too Much with Us

The world is too much with us: late and soon,
 Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers –
 Little we see in Nature that is ours –
 We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! 
This sea that bares her bosom to the moon,
 The winds that will be howling at all hours
 And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;
 For this, for every thing, we are out of tune:
 It moves us not. Great God! I’d rather be
 A pagan suckled in a creed outworn
 So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
 Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn –
 Have sight of Proteus coming from the sea,
 Or hear old Triton blow his wreath
                ed
               horn.
