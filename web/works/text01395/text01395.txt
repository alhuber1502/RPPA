Dream of Dying

Shivering in fever, weak, and parched to sand,
 My ears, those entrances of word-dressed thoughts,
 My pictured eyes, and my assuring touch,
 Fell from me, and my body turned me forth
 From its beloved abode: then I was dead;
 And in my grave beside my corpse I sat,
 In vain attempting to return: meantime
 There came the untimely spectres of two babes,
 And played in my abandoned bodyâ€™s ruins;
 They went away; and, one by one, by snakes
 My limbs were swallowed; and, at last, I sat
 With only one, blue-eyed, curled round my ribs,
 Eating the last remainder of my heart,
 And hissing to himself. O sleep, thou fiend! 
Thou blackness of the night! how sad and frightful
 Are these thy dreams!
