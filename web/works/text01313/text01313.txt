The Poet

The stars all sought out a new road
Scattering ancient night:
The stars all gloried in their life
And sang the praise of God.

Alone, and sadly counting out
The years, far from all eyes,
The dumb earth rolled its dreary way,
Orphan of happy skies.

Without a song it travelled on,
Again without a song
It moved, and on its lips it bore
A seal of silent gloom.

Who can give it voice? ... A heavenly ray
Fell on a mortal tongue,
From the body of a mortal man
Came an immortal song.

He raised his quiet gaze to heaven,
His soul leapt to rejoice
In God, and to the dark created world
He gave harmonious voice.
