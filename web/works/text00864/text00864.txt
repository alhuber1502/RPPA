The Glove

A Tale

King Lrancis sits in royal state
above his lion garden’s gate
and around him on the balcony
the ladies in high revelry
the impending fray await.

With a simple gesture of his hand
the den opens wide
and a single lion leaves the band
and without breaking his stride
gazes all around
without a sound,
stretches his limbs, shakes his mane,
and with a yawn and a frown
proceeds to lie down.

When the king waves once more
a second door
opens quietly
and with a wild leap
a tiger rushes
from the keep
and gives a mighty roar
on seeing the lion
on the floor.
His dreadful tail whips the air
and with his tongue
stuck out there
and a ferocious purr
he lies down
in a sullen dare
near the lion who does not stir.

When the king waves yet again
the doubly opened den
vents two leopards all at once
who keen for the battle pounce
on the recumbent tiger;
he seizes them with furious
paws when the lion, curious,
rises with a mighty roar;
the beasts sink in a circle to the floor.
The dread felines heated by blood lust
all couch in the dust.

Then on the balcony high above
from a snow-white hand falls a glove
right in the middle between
recumbent tiger and lion serene.

And coy Mistress Kunigunde turns
in a manner teasing to the Knight Delorges
and lisps, “if your love for me burns
as bright as you swear by the stars above
then go down and fetch me that glove.”

And the knight in rapid stride
descends to the pit which none dare abide
and sure of foot but trembling not
picks up that fallen glove
with bold fingers from the dire spot.

The noble company in awe and dread
observe the knight they already deemed dead
bear back that glove with collected calm;
from every mouth flows praise and balm,
but with the tenderest glance of love
that promises transcendent joys
Mistress Kunigunde welcomes
him to his deserved bliss.
And rejecting her kiss
in her fair face he throws the glove
saying, “the reward is not in your power,”
and leaves her that very hour.
