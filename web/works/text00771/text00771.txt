Fragments of a Lost Gnostic Poem of the 12th Century

Found a family, build a state,
The pledged event is still the same:
Matter in end will never abate
His ancient brutal claim.

Indolence is heavenâ€™s ally here,
And energy the child of hell:
The Good Alan pouring from his pitcher clear
But brims the poisoned well.
