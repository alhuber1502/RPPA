Statue Horse

One evening, walking in the public way,
 A peasant of the valley where I dwelt
 Being my chance companion, he stopped short
 And pointed to an object full in view
 At a small distance. ’Twas a horse, that stood
 Alone upon a little breast of ground
 With a clear silver moonlight sky behind. 
With one leg from the ground the creature stood,
 Insensible and still: breath, motion, gone –
 Hairs, colour, all but shape and substance, gone –
 Mane, ears, and tail, as lifeless as the trunk
 That had no stir of breath! We paused awhile
 In pleasure of the sight, and left him there,
 With all his functions silently sealed up,
 Like an amphibious work of Nature’s hand,
 A borderer dwelling betwixt life and death,
 A living statue or a statued life.
