Love

When a sound drifts from the field,
I always greet a friend,
It speaks to me: why do you yield?
See how love the sun does send:
Heart to heart, always blend,
The bad hours will be healed.

Love must think in music sweetly,
for all thought is too remote.
Only music can denote
all that love desires completely.
Love we know and know her only
when the voice of music sounds;
while her magic still abounds,
love can never leave us lonely.
Love would die a sterile death,
did not music lend her breath.
