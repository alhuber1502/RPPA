I Love My Jean

Of a’ the airts the wind can blaw,
 I dearly like the west;
 For there the bonny lassie lives,
 The lassie I lo’e best:
 There’s wild-woods grow, and rivers row,
 And mony a hill between;
 But day and night my fancy’s flight
 Is ever wi’ my Jean! 

I see her in the dewy flowers,
 I see her sweet and fair;
 I hear her in the tunefu’ birds,
 I hear her charm the air –
 There’s not a bonny flower that springs
 By fountain, shaw, or green;
 There’s not a bonny bird that sings,
 But minds me o’ my Jean!
