Oh, Man can seek the downward glance...

Oh, Man can seek the downward glance,
And each kind word — affection’s spell —
Eye, voice, its value can enhance;
For eye may speak, and tongue can tell.

But Woman’s love, it waits the while
To echo to another’s tone,
To linger on another’s smile,
Ere dare to answer with its own.
