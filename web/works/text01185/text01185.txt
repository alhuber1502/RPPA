Art

Yes, the work goes forth more beautiful
From refractory form
Intractable,
Verse, marble, onyx, enamel.

No false constraints!
To walk straight
Wear,
Muse, a narrow buskin.

Shame on commodious rhythms,
An outsized shoe
That
Every foot steps in and out.

Sculptor, refuse
The clay the hand
Shapes
When the mindls elsewhere;

Fight with Carrara,
Hard Paros
And rare,
Keepers of the pure Contour;

Borrow of Syracuse
Its bronze where the proud
Enchanting
Line declares itself;

With a délicate hand
Follow in a Vein
Of agate
The profile of Apollo.

Painter, nm from water colours
And fix the too frail
Shade
In the enamelier’s oven;

Create blue sirens,
Twisting every way
Their tails,
Heraldic monsters;

In their triple nimbus
The Virgin and her Jesus,
The globe
With the cross above.

Everything passes — vigorous art
Alone to eternity:
The bust
Outlives the city.

And the austere medal
That the workman finds
Underground
Reveals an emperor.

The gods themselves die,
But the sovereign verses
Remain
Stronger than bronze.

Sculpt, file, chisel,
That your floating dream
Seals itself
Within the resistant block!
