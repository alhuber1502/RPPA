The St James’s Phenomenon

[Ll. 1-30, 46-50, 61-65, 71-75]

Good people all attend now,
 And I’ll tell ye of such a monster
 As shall make your eyes
 Be double their size
 And the hats that ye have on stir! 

I’m aware there’ve been before this
 As pretty frights as may be –
 Two sisters in one,
 And babes like a tun,
 And much worse things than they be. 

For I’ve heard of an unlegged body
 That went about on castors,
 And a head that would come
 Bolt into a room
 And cry, ‘How now, my masters?’ 

But Lord! all these were handsome
 To the one I’m going to mention –
 To whom a shark
 Is a perfect spark,
 And an ogre deserves a pension. 

Hard by St James’s Palace
 You may see this Prince of Shockings;
 But not before three,
 For at one, d’ye see,
 He begins to put on his stockings! 

His head, or else what should be
 In the place that’s on his shoulders,
 Is nothing but hair,
 Frizzled here and there
 To the terror of all beholders! 

Of his fingers a tailor tells me
 (For one here and there the truth picks)
 That the right, when they span,
 Are a lady’s fan,
 And the left a start of toothpicks. 

His organs of digestion
 Make a noise like the wheels of mangles;
 His tongue’s a skin,
 And hollow within,
 And his teeth are dice at angles. 

N.B. Behave respectful;
 For if he thinks you flout him,
 He’s got a big
 Old judges’ wig
 Wherewith he lays about him!
