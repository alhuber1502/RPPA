In the Countryside

A ghastly sympathy did my soul divine between the sterile drought of the earth and the aridity of the heat. It found no feeling of love nor amity, neither in others nor myself, and all about, barren and sad, the countryside, without energy, watched me with a stupid satisfaction from her empty and lively fecundity, like a volcano under a sea of lava. I savoured that gloomy pleasure of my suffering in that of others ... My soul whiled away those bitter hours which, perhaps, we desire that all may feel, for everything suffers with us; and to the pale flowers and the shrivelled tree I gave my soul in deepest pain, to have for my anguish an echo, to console myself in the grief of the world.
