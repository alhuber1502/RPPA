To My Russian Friends

Do you recall me? When I muse on friends,
when death and jail and exile are my themes,
you crowd upon me from the world’s far ends;
you, foreigners, are citizens of my dreams.

Where are you now? Ruileyev’s noble frame,
which once my arms embraced, his agonies stilled,
rots on a gallows in the Tsar’s great name.
Curst be the land that sees its prophets killed!

Bestuzhev, poet and soldier, held my hand.
His hand’s now torn from sword and pen, his doom
to drag a barrow at the Tsar’s command,
handcuffed beside a Pole, in pits of gloom.

Others, maybe, bear heavier loads by far.
One, branded with the honours of the state,
has sold his freeborn spirit to the Tsar
and cringes on the doorsteps of the great.

With salaried tongue he praises every yoke
and grins with triumph when a comrade bleeds.
Smeared with my blood, he now betrays my folk
and brags in pious terms of vilest deeds.

If these grieved notes sent forth in a free nation
reach northward, rising high, until they ring
across your earth of frozen desolation,
they’ll tell of freedom as storks tell of spring.

You’ll know my voice. I played a prisoner’s part,
to cheat the despot, with a serpent’s guile;
but, when with you, I bared my hidden heart
and kept the dove’s simplicity in my smile.

Now to all men my venomed rage I pour,
a bitterness burning from tormented veins.
My country’s tears and blood are at its core:
Let it consume, not you, friends, but your chains.

If one of you should snarl, his raucous spites
As barks of a scared dog will sound to me —
a dog so long enchained he blindly bites
the kindly hand that brings him liberty.
