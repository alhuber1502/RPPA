Arion

We numbered many in the ship;
Some spread the sails, some pulled, together,
The mighty oars; fair was the weather.
The rudder in his steady grip,
Our helmsman silently was steering
The heavy galley through the sea,
While I, in blithe serenity,
Sang to the crew ... when suddenly
A rough gust swooped, the waves were rearing ...
The helmsman and the crew were lost!
No sailor by the storm was tossed
Ashore â€” but I who had been singing.
I chant the hymns I sang before,
And dry my garments, wetly clinging,
Upon the sunned and rocky shore.
