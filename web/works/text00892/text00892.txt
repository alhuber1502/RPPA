A Woman's Letter

Women, I know, are not supposed to write; I write
All the same,
So that in my distant heart, as when you left, you may read
My name.

I will write nothing that is not much more beautiful
Seen in you.
But a word repeated a hundred times from a lover
Still sounds new.

May it carry you to bliss! Me, I still await it here,
Although, out yonder,
I also seem to stray, so as to listen and to peer
When your footsteps wander.

Do not turn away if along the path you see a swallow
Travel by.
For I think it will be I who will pass to touch your hand,
Faithfully.

You go, all goes! Everything pushes on, lights
And flowers.
The summer follows, leaving me the thunder, weeping
In showers.

But if we no longer can see, and we live off hope
And fears,
Let us split things for the best: you keep the hope, and I
The tears.

No, as long as we are united, I would not want to see you
Suffering:
To wish ill to oneâ€™s sacred half is to suffer
The same thing.
