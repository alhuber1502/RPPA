Heart, heart, lie still...

“Heart, heart, lie still,
Life is fleeting fast,
Strife will soon be past,” —

“I cannot lie still,
Beat strong I will” —

“Heart, heart, lie still,
Joy’s but joy, and pain’s but pain
Either, little loss or gain,” —

“I cannot lie still,
Beat strong I will.”

“Heart, heart, lie still,
Heaven is over all,
Rules this earthly ball,” —

“I cannot lie still,
Beat strong I will” —

“Heart, heart, lie still —

“Heaven’s sweet grace alone
Can keep in peace its own
Let that me fill
And I am still” —
