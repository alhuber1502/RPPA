Rhyme XIII: Imitation of Byron

Your eye is blue and, when you laugh,
Its gentle splendor seems to me
The morningâ€™s trembling radiance
Reflected on the sea.

Your eye is blue and, when you weep,
The lucent tears that rise in it
Seem images of drops of dew
Upon a violet.

Your eye is blue and, if a thought
Shines deep within, a point of light,
I see it as a brilliant star
Lost in the sky at night.
