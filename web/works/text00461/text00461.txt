Solitude

[excerpt]

In the dawn of my flowering youth I saw its enchantments offer themselves to my desires; glory, riches, as many false gifts that man seeks after in his blind delirium .... In swift flight twenty five years of my life passed by, and the enchanting picture fled with them; it flew, I turned my gaze, I let out a cry ... and instead of flowers I saw a desert.
