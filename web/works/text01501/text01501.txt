Morning Song

I came to you with a greeting,
 To tell you the sun has arisen,
 With his hot happy light
 He is trembling among the leaves;

To tell you the forest is waking,
 Every twig is awaking,
 And every bird is shaking his wings,
 Is full of the thirst of spring;

With all of the midnight’s passion
   Again in the morning I come,
 And my spirit is still as eager
   To wait upon joy and you;

And all of the winds of the heaven   
Blow happiness to me,
 And I know not the theme of the singing,
 But a song is lifdng its wings.
