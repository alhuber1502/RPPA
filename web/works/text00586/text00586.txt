Sky-Blue Flower

[excerpt]

‘Are you rapt in stars again
 And in clouds of lofty skies? 
Mind you don’t forget my eyes,
 You, the dearest of all men!’ 

‘Vainly do you cram up notions
 Of a sun criss-crossed by rills
 Of Assyrian plains and hills
 Of the ever darkling oceans;’ 

‘Pyramids of some old day
 Raise their tapers to the sky
 Oh, my soul’s life, never try
 To seek bliss so far away!’ 

So my darling used her craft –
 Gently she caressed my hair;
 She had told the truth, I swear:
 I made no reply, just laughed. 

‘Let us flee to forests green
 Where in valleys springs lament
 And a rock is downwards bent
 Over each deep-cleft ravine.’ 

‘Where the forest’s brow is split
 By the pond that’s free from weeds,
 In the shade of quiet reeds
 ’Mong the blackberries we’ll sit.’ 

‘When through boughs we see the moon –
 Empress of the summer night –
 By the waist you’ll hold me tight
 And together we shall spoon.’ 

‘While descending under bowers
 To our village in the glen
 I’ll give you a kiss again
 Sweet as shyly hiding flowers.’ 

‘And, if reaching mother’s gate,
 We shall whisper in the dark,
 Nobody will mind our lark:
 Just who cares my love’s so great?’ 

One more kiss – she vanishes
 I stay in the moonlight dazed:
 Of, how beautiful, how crazed,
 And how sweet my flower is! 

Wonder sweet, you left your thrall:
 Our love lived but an hour. 
Sky-blue flower, sky-blue flower! ... 
Sad is this world after all.
