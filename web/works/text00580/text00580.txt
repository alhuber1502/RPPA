Recollections

These mountains wake in me the self-same feeling
 As those where as a boy I used to dwell;
 The cool wind as of old is full of healing,
 The same light bathes yon snow-crowned citadel. 
Like a lost language from my childhood stealing,
 It makes me pensive and yet glad as well. 
The early memories rise so thick before me
 I scarce can breathe as they come flooding o’er me. 

Yes, life again through every vein is streaming
 As when through snow I saw green grass arise;
 I dream now, as I once was always dreaming
 When I saw mountains pierce the azure skies. 
I can escape from frenzied strife and scheming,
 When the rich sunset spreads its glowing dyes. 
I find a home where comfort and repose is,
 When such a sea of light the world encloses. 

But all is lovelier now than I had feigned me,
 More limpidly I see the daylight burn;
 And that which cut so sharply that it pained me
 Softens the shadows now at eve’s return. 
What tempted to the misdeeds that have stained me
 Makes now the very mountain side less stern. 
Old thoughts grow ever kinder with repeating;
 ’Tis the same heart in me more calmly beating. 

Each stone I knew. I find a comrade in it,
 For there it was, a boy, I used to play. 
And if there was a fight, why, who could win it,
 Came out more strong for each and every fray. 
It all comes back, as minute after minute
 The sun behind the snow-crest fades away. 
And so at last they cradle me in slumber,
 Old shadows and old memories without number.
