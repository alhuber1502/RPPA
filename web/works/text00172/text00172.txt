Music, When Soft Voices Die

Music, when soft voices die,
 Vibrates in the memory;
 Odours, when sweet violets sicken,
 Live within the sense they quicken. 

Rose leaves, when the rose is dead,
 Are heaped for the belovéd’s bed;
 And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,
 Love itself shall slumber on.
