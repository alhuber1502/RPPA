Longing

So golden the stars were shining.
At the window I stood alone.
Through silent fields far echoed
A posthom’s joyous toue -.
My heart caught fire, inflaming
My secret thought’s delight:
Who would nöt, too, go roving
On a lovely summer’s night?

And down the mountain pathway
Two youths came striding by;
The songs that they were singing
Awoke the silent sky.
They sang of rustling forests,
Where gorges meet the sight,
Of torrents downward gushing
Toward the forest’s night.

They sang of marble statues,
And palaces of stone,
Of gardens in the moonlight,
Their misty bowers o’ergrown;
Where maids at casements listen,
When lutes their hearts excite,
And drowsy fountains murmur
On a lovely summer’s night.
