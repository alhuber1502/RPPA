To Mrs Reynolds’ Cat

Cat, who has past thy grand climacteric,
 How many mice and rats hast in thy days
 Destroyed? How many titbits stolen? Gaze
 With those bright languid segments green, and prick
 Those velvet ears – but prithee do not stick
 Thy latent talons in me, and upraise
 Thy gentle mew, and tell me all the frays
 Of fish and mice, and rats and tender chick. 
Nay, look not down, nor lick thy dainty wrists –
 For all the wheezy asthma, and for all
 Thy tail’s tip is nicked off, and though the fists
 Of many a maid have given thee many a maul,
 Still is that fur as soft as when the lists
 In youth thou enteredst on glass-bottled wall!
