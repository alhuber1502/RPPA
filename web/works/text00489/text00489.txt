The Golden Horns

UPON the pages
 Of far gone ages
 In hills where are lying
 The dead they are prying;
 On armour rusty,
 In ruins musty,
 On Rune-stones jumbled,
 With bones long crumbled. 

Deeds of old, in guesses
 Beheld, are enticing,
 But a mist possesses
 The ancient writing. 
With eye-balls fixed,
 With thoughts perplexed,
 In darkness they grope
 Vainly they hope
 ‘You days far gone,
 A glimpse anon! 
Of Heaven united with Earth
 Of a shimmering light in the North!’ 

Cloud is bustling,
 Night is rustling
 Grave-hills sighing
 Rose petals dying
 The reaches above rebound
 With voices of godlike sound
 The mighty and daring
 Their spirits there muster
 War stains bearing
 In eye star lustre. 

‘You who are blind,
 Straying, praying,
 A relic shall find
 It glitters and speaks, then leaves you behind
 Its red sides of gold
 A stamp displaying
 Of times most old. 

Of this you shall learn
 Devotion to earn. 
Our gift is your duty! 
A maid,
 Of beauty most rare
 The shrine shall dare.’ 
This said,
 Their songs die away in the air. 

Hrymfax, the black,
 Snorting, ducking
 The ocean rolls over his back. 
Delling, emerging
 Morn’s gates unlocking:
 Skinfax, advancing,
 On sky bow prancing,
 With lustre glancing. 

Little birds quaver,
 Night-pearls weeping,
 Flowers steeping
 In winds which waver. 
A fleet-footed maiden, dancing so gay
 Crowned with a garland,
 Then gliding away,
 Cheeks are burning,
 Lily-hands turning;
 Light as a hind
 Playful in mind
 Smiling, frisking
 Onwards she’s whisking,
 Thinks on her lover,
 Trips something over! 
Eyes declining,
 Aware of a shining,
 She reddens and shakes,
 And trembling she takes,
 This wondering sprite
 From dingy mould,
 With hands snow-white,
 The ruddy gold. 

A gentle thunder
 Peals! 
The whole North wonder
 Feels! 
Forth rush with gabble
 A countless rabble
 Earth upturning
 For treasure burning. 
But there is no gold! 
Their hope is mistaken:
 They see but the mould,
 From where it was taken. 

Time passes

Again it blusters
 Rain-soaked mountains,
 Shattering fountains
 Burst in fury. 
Spirits of glory
 From Norway’s highlands
 To Denmark’s islands,
 In clouded halls meet
 They join and they greet. 

‘For the few there below
 Who our offering know
 Who Earth’s fetters spurn
 And whose souls are soaring
 To the everlasting turn;
 Who in the eye of Nature
 Behold the Creator;
 And tremble adoring,
 In rays of His power
 In sun and in flower,
 The least and the first,
 Are burning with thirst
 For a life from the spring:
 But see, you mighty sprite
 Of days passed away on the tide
 Behold thy own eye so bright
 Reflected in gold on the side
 For them our ‘Stay!’ shall ring. 
‘Nature’s son, of name
 Unknown to fame
 Digging, planting
 Strong-armed and tall,
 Like his forefathers all,
 His honour we’re chanting
 He shall reclaim it, all unaided’
 They sang and so faded. 

Hrymfax, the black,
 Snorting, ducking
 The ocean rolls over his back. 
Delling, emerging
 Morn’s gates unlocking:
 Skinfax, advancing,
 On sky bow prancing,
 With lustre glancing. 
By the sheltering shaws
 The oxen striding
 A heavy plough draws
 The black soil dividing. 

The plough stops short, and a drove
 Of shudders rushes
 All through the grove;
 The bird-quire hushes
 Sudden its strains;
 Holy silence
 Everywhere reigns. 

Then rings in mould
 The ancient gold. 

A double glimpse from periods old
 In the days we inhabit, sparkling,
 Strangely returned those visions of gold,
 Their sides with puzzles darkling. 

A strange craft hovers
 O’er their signs, a sense to ponder
 Glory the Godhead covers
 These eternal works, such wonder. 

Honour them, for nought is stable;
 They may vanish, past all seeking. 
Let Christ’s blood on Christ’s own table
 Fill them, once with red blood reeking. 

But their sheen is all you know
 Not their honour high
 And their lustre’s put on show
 For a dull unwitting eye

Storm-winds bellow, blacken heaven! 
Comes the fateful hour near;
 Back is taken what was given, –
 Vanished is the token here.
