A young man loves a maiden ...

A young man loves a maiden
Who chooses another instead;
This other loves still another
And these two haply wed.

The maiden out of anger
Marries, with no regard,
The first good man she runs into â€”
The young lad takes it hard.

It is so old a story,
Yet somehow always new;
And he that has just lived it,
It breaks his heart in two.
