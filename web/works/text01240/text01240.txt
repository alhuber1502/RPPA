Be Silent!

There are, by our green coasts and by our beaches,
those bitter cliffs of our unending foam,
strange-named beings with a strange enchantment
who share with us alone their peaceful home.

There are, within the shadows of our oak woods,
within the fountain’s song, or by our little farms,
spirits of love who sing to people born here,
that only hold the native in their arms.

There is, in all that has its life or being,
in our high hillsides, in our skies above,
a softened colour, and a moist transparence,
a mist that only we know how to love.

You, who are warmed by flames of fiercer planets,
who flourish only when the sun breathes fire,
you who were born alongside alien shores,
be silent, if you cannot feel our magic,
as I am silent, I who can’t feel yours.
