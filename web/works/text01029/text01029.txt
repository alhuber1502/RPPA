Château Boncourt

I dream I am back in childhood,
And I shake my graying head;
Why do you come to me, visions
I thought long forgotten and dead!

A shining castle looms above
A walled and shady estate;
I know the towers and battlements,
I know the stone bridge and gate.

The Lions on the coat of arms
Regard me as an intimate;
I greet the old acquaintances
And hasten to the inner court.

There the sphinx lies at the fountain,
The fig tree there is turning green,
And there, behind these windows,
I dreamt away my earliest dream.

I enter the castle chapel
And seek my ancestor's bier;
There they are: there from a pillar
Hang the old sword and spear.

My tear-dimmed eyes cannot yet read
The inscription on the tomb
However bright through colored panes
The sunlight floods the room.

You stand thus firmly in my mind,
My fathers’ castle, but now
You are no longer found on earth;
You lie beneath the plow.

O be fruitful, dearest soil,
In my heart I bless you,
And I bless the plowman twice
Who may now possess you.

But it time I roused myself,
Took my lyre in my hand,
And went roaming through the world
To sing from land to land.
