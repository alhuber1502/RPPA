The Nights

[The night of October (excerpt)]

THE POET

My griefs have vanished like a midnight dream;
 All I remember of them I compare
 To those light mists that rise at morning’s gleam. 
And, with the dewdrops, melt into the air. 

THE MUSE

What grief was it, O Poet, tell,
 That seared your heart up like a spell,
 And parted our fond souls in twain? 
Tho’ deeply in your heart conceal’d,
 Each accent and each glance reveal’d
 The woes I’ve long time mourned in vain. 

THE POET

It was a vulgar evil, and well known;
 But oftentimes when we are sick at soul,
 We think that we, of all the world alone,
 Are crushed with misery beyond control. 

THE MUSE

It cannot be a vulgar grief
 That comes not from a vulgar mind;
 But tell me all that lurks behind,
 And give your aching heart relief. 
Oh, trust me, and confess with truth
 That Silence’ God, in very sooth,
 Is brother to the God of Death. 
Telling our woes we ofttimes heal
 The very ills that we reveal,
 And mourn and cure them in a breath. 

THE POET

If I must tell thee of my suffering,
 I scarcely know what name it ought to bear,
 Whether it rose from love, or was a thing
 Of pride and folly and my own despair. 
But now I will unfold my burning pain,
 Since we are here, alone beside the fire,
 If thou, dear Muse, wilt lull my racking brain,
 As in my happier days, with thy loved lyre. 

THE MUSE

Before you tell me your harsh fate
 Drive cruel rancor far away;
 For, Poet, you must speak to-day
 Without a trace of love or hate. 
If you remember long ago
 You held me soother of your heart –
 Then would you have me take a part
 In passions which have wrought your woe? 

THE POET

So well I conquered all this hideous strife,
 That sometimes when I dream me of my ill,
 In those same spots I risked my boyhood’s life
 A stranger takes the place I wont to fill. 
Be fearless then, O Muse, and mark, that while
 I tell my woes, there is no fond regret;
 Sweet it is to weep, but sweeter still to smile
 At the thoughts of woes we are able to forget. 

THE MUSE

Like a watchful mother bending
 O’er the cradle of her son,
 So I rest, while you are blending
 Future hopes with deeds misdone. 
Speak, O Poet, and my lyre
 Shall every trembling accent fire,
 And lull you with its wonted lays,
 Till, in a flood of silver light,
 Like some vision gay and bright,
 Fades all the gloom of bygone days. 

THE POET

Loved nights of toil, of darling solitude,
 O nights of toil when life sped fast –
 To my old study, in my wonted mood,
 Thank God! I have come back at last. 
Tho’ oft deserted, how I love each wall –
 Each book upon the dusty shelves! 
Remember, Muse, how it was all in all,
 A universe for our two selves! 
When to the careless scoffing world I told
 The burning songs I heard from you.
