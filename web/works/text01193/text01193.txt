Great father Dante ...

Great father Dante, if from heav’n you see
this not unworthy pupil of your art,
heaving sad sighs from his profoundest heart,
and bending at your tombstone now his knee,

oh, kindly let one ray of all your light
answer these yearnings still so fair in me:
must one for endless bright eternity
against all cowardice and envy fight?

“My son, I fought — and much to my regret,
for to a throng my name did I bestow,
too base to earn the honor of my feet.

If me you trust, why bend your gaze so low?
thunder and win, and if once more you meet
such people, crush them all, and fiercely go.”
