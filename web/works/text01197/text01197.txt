A crooked beak ...

A crooked beak, and strong and sturdy claws,
two mighty-sounding wings that soar and run,
and an undaunted glance that dares the sun,
are still a valiant eagle’s lofty boast.

From such a noble bird my name I’ve had:
sweating beneath their arms, in days of yore
my ancient sires the thundering eagles bore,
whose winning glory made the Rhine flow red.

Whate’er its source, my name is high and bright:
With wings and beak and claws and heart of steel
I will defend its honor and its wonder.

Only to me pure Phoebus did reveal
his inmost light: with me who dares to fight,
if Jove has placed in this my hand his thunder?
