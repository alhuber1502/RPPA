The Prelude

[Book IX. ‘Residence in France’, ll. 40-71 (A Tourist’s Unconcern: Paris, Dec. 1791)]

Through Paris lay my readiest path, and there
 I sojourned a few days and visited
 In haste each spot of old and recent fame –
 The latter chiefly – from the Field of Mars
 Down to the suburbs of St Antony,
 And from Mont Martyr southward to the Dome
 Of Genevieve. In both her clamorous halls
 (The National Synod and the Jacobins)
 I saw the revolutionary power
 Toss like a ship at anchor, rocked by storms;
 The Arcades I traversed in the Palace huge
 Of Orleans, coasted round and round the line
 Of tavern, brothel, gaming-house and shop –
 Great rendezvous of worst and best, the walk
 Of all who had a purpose, or had not! 
I stared, and listened with a stranger’s ears
 To hawkers and haranguers (hubbub wild!) 
And hissing factionists with ardent eyes,
 In knots, or pairs, or single – ant-like swarms
 Of builders and subverters, every face
 That hope or apprehension could put on:
 Joy, anger and vexation, in the midst
 Of gaiety and dissolute idleness. 
Where silent zephyrs sported with the dust
 Of the Bastille I sat in the open sun
 And from the rubbish gathered up a stone,
 And pocketed the relic in the guise
 Of an enthusiast; yet, in honest truth
 Though not without some strong incumbencies,
 And glad – could living man be otherwise? –
 I looked for something which I could not find,
 Affecting more emotion than I felt.
