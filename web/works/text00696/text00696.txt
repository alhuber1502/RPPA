He Bade Me Be Happy

He bade me “Be happy,” he whisper’d “Forget me;”
He vow’d my affection was cherish’d in vain.
“Be happy!” “Forget me!” I would, if he’d let me —
Why will he keep coming to say so again?

He came — it was not the first time, by a dozen —
To take, as he said, “an eternal adieu;”
He went, and, for comfort, I turn’d to — my cousin,
When back stalk’d the torment his vows to renew.

“You must love me no longer!” he said but this morning.
“I love you no longer!” I meekly replied.
“Is this my reward?” he cried; “falsehood and scorning
From her who was ever my idol, my pride!”
