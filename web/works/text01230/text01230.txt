Sunflower

O sweet night, in the middle of the sky
your bright moon hangs, gleaming.
And a thousand stars shining beside it.
What softness in your warbling breeze!

All is calm; neither wind nor the songs
of the night birds can slip in;
the flowers and the plants in the garden
come alive tonight beneath your cool shade.

Only the vague whispers
of papery leaves and blades of grass,
only the crawling of insects might interrupt
your peace of mind here, O night.

You who watch quietly by my side,
constant lover of the light of day,
only you, sunflower, can disdain
the pale hours of the summer night.

Inclining, wilted, over your long neck,
dark head among your own tangled locks,
you are waiting for that first gleam of dawn,
unmoved by the night and its freshness,

and you gladly raise your drooping head,
beautiful flower, set on day’s arrival,
and then, your lover, crowned
with burning flames presents himself.

His light covers the hills and plains,
his fiery earth surrounds you,
you’re gazing back while you drink from the ray
his bright red flames are spilling through.

Ouch, sad flower! his force bellows
voraciously and snuffs your precious life.
But now your lover passes to the west
and there you turn your pallid face.

Your frightened leaves unfolding
as if they are ready to fly,
and carry you, heart beating, up from your stalk
to the divine sun that disappears.

You watched him slowly hide himself
while the earth became flooded with shadows.
Again and again he shone in the east
and over and over he hid himself again.

Exhausted by the weight of the hours,
by burning siestas, consumed,
lifeless, dry and stripped of leaves,
you are falling to pieces, turned to dust.

What good was your ambition?
No matter how high your arrogance flew,
your miserable root just died in the ground;
the beautiful sun you adored

will cross from its summit tomorrow
over your sad and gloomy pyre.
His eyes won’t even stop to see
that you were consumed by the love of his fire.
