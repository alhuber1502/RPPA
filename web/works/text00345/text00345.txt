Song

Mary leave thy lowly cot
 When thy thickest jobs are done,
 When thy friends will miss thee not
 Mary to the pastures run –
 Where we met the other night
 ’Neath the bush upon the plain,
 Be it dark or be it light
 Ye may guess we’ll meet again! 

Should ye go or should ye not
 Never shilly-shally dear,
 Leave your work and leave your cot
 Nothing need ye doubt or fear:
 Chaps may tell ye lies in spite –
 Calling me a roving swain –
 Think what passed the other night,
 Then I’m bound we’ll meet again!
