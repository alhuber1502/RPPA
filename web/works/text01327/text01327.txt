My Native Land

I love my native land but love it strangely; reason
Has vainly tried to make this love less strange:
The glory bought by blood and treason,
The proud serenity that will not pass or change,
The sacred chronicles of the heroic nation —
None ever strikes a spark in my imagination.

How odd that I am moved by simpler things!
By rustling woods on infinite expanses,
The silent steppe that neither speaks nor answers,
The overflowing streams that swell like seas in spring.
I also like to ride through country starkness
And from the cart to look at the surrounding sights;
To dream of restful sleep and search the gloomy darkness
For mournful villages with ever-trembling lights.
I love the smoke of burning stubble,
The steppe and drays, the midnight sky,
And on a hill a tender couple —
Two birches, white in yellow rye.
Perhaps like few, I find it pleasant
To see a garner full of grain,
Carved shutters made by patient peasants,
The thatch resisting snow and rain.
And when the countryside rejoices,
When Sunday night is fresh and damp,
I love to hear men’s drunken voices
And see them whistle, dance, and stamp.
