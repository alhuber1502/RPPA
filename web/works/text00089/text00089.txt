Epistle to J. H. Reynolds

[Ll. 82 – 105]

It is a flaw
 In happiness to see beyond our bourne –
 It forces us in summer skies to mourn;
 It spoils the singing of the nightingale. 
Dear Reynolds, I have a mysterious tale
 And cannot speak it. The first page I read
 Upon a limpit-rock of green sea-weed
 Among the breakers. ’Twas a quiet eve;
 The rocks were silent; the wide sea did weave
 An untumultuous fringe of silver foam
 Along the flat brown sand. I was at home,
 And should have been most happy, but I saw
 Too far into the sea, where every maw,
 The greater on the less, feeds evermore –
 But I saw too distinct into the core
 Of an eternal fierce destruction,
 And so from happiness I far was gone. 
Still am I sick of it; and though today
 I’ve gathered young spring-leaves, and flowers gay
 Of periwinkle and wild strawberry,
 Still do I that most fierce destruction see:
 The shark at savage prey, the hawk at pounce,
 The gentle robin, like a pard or ounce,
 Ravening a worm.
