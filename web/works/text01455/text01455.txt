Spring in the Students' Quarter

Winter is passing, and the bells
   For ever with their silver lay
   Murmur a melody that tells
   Of April and of Easter day. 
High in sweet air the light vane sets,
 The weathercocks all southward twirl;
 A sou will buy her violets   
And make Nini a happy girl

The winter to the poor was sore,
 Counting the weary winter days. 
Watching his little firewood store,
 The bitter snowflakes fall always;
 And now his last log dimly gleamed,
 Lighting the room with feeble glare,
 Half cinder and half smoke it seemed   
That the wind wasted into air. 

Pilgrims from ocean and far isles   
See where the eaR is reddening,
 The flocks that fly a thousand miles   
From sunsetting to sunsetting;
 Look up, look out, behold the swallows,
 The throats that twitter, the wings that beat;
 And on their song the summer follows,
 And in the summer life is sweet. 

With the green tender buds that know
   The shoot and sap of lusty spring   
My neighbor of a year ago   
Her casement, see, is opening;
 Through all the bitter months that were,
 Forth from her neR she dared not flee,
 She was a Rudy for Boucher,
 She now may sit to Gavarni.
