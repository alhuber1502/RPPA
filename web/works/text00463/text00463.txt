My Suffering

The happy spring passes swiftly, scattering roses and crowning love, and the dry summer, scattering petals, gathers together sheaves on the burnt threshing floor. Yet the season flattering Bacchus returns to give life to meadows and shepherds, and winter is about to announce its rigours, slowing down the course of the warm sun. I, once and again and again, was witness to roses in May and seeing the corn wave in summer; I saw the abundant fruit of autumn and the sterile ice of impious winter, the hasty seasons fly by ... And only my pain lasts eternally!
