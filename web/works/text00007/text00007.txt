Strange Fits of Passion I Have Known

Strange fits of passion I have known,
 And I will dare to tell
 But in the lover’s ear alone
 What once to me befell. 

When she I loved was strong and gay
 And like a rose in June,
 I to her cottage bent my way
 Beneath the evening moon. 

Upon the moon I fixed my eye
 All over the wide lea;
 My horse trudged on, and we drew nigh
 Those paths so dear to me. 

And now we reached the orchard-plot,
 And as we climbed the hill
 Towards the roof of Lucy’s cot
 The moon descended still. 

In one of those sweet dreams I slept,
 Kind Nature’s gentlest boon,
 And all the while my eyes I kept
 On the descending moon. 

My horse moved on – hoof after hoof
 He raised and never stopped –
 When down behind the cottage-roof
 At once the planet dropped. 

What fond and wayward thoughts will slide
 Into a lover’s head:
 ‘Oh mercy’, to myself I cried,
 ‘If Lucy should be dead!’
