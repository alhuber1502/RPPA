I Love the Jocund Dance

I love the jocund dance,
 The softly-breathing song,
 Where innocent eyes do glance,
 And where lisps the maidenâ€™s tongue. 

I love the laughing vale,
 I love the echoing hill,
 Where mirth does never fail,
 And the jolly swain laughs his fill. 

I love the pleasant cot,
 I love the innocent bower. 
Where white and brown is our lot,
 Or fruit in the midday hour. 

I love the oaken seat
 Beneath the oaken tree,
 Where all the old villagers meet,
 And laugh our sports to see. 

I love our neighbours all,
 But, Kitty, I better love thee;
 And love them I ever shall;
 But thou art all to me.
