Oh How I Adore You!

O how I adore you! At the light of day I invoke your name with passion and sadness and, when the heavens gown themselves with shadows, still my exalted soul calls out your name. You are the mark of time which guides my hours, you are the idea which aids my mind, for in you everything that exists is concentrated, my passion, my hopes, my poetry. There is no song which can equal your song when you tell me of your love and you delight in revealing the faith of your contentment. I tremble at your voice and tremble if you look at me and I would desire to exhale my last breath burned in the air you breathe.
