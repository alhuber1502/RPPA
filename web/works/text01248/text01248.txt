Svetlana

Once on Twelfth Night
Girls were telling fortunes:
They removed their shoes from their feet
And threw them over the gates;
They raked the snow; they listened
Under the window; they fed
A chicken a certain number of pieces of grain;
They put hot wax in water;
They put a gold ring
And emerald earrings
Into a glass of pure water;
They laid out a white kerchief
And over a cup they sang
Ritual songs in harmony.

The moon shines dimly
In the hazy mist —
Dear Svetlana
Is quiet and sad.
“Little friend, what’s wrong with you?
Say something;
Listen to the round-song;
Pull out a little ring for yourself.
Sing, my beauty: ‘Smithy,
Forge me a new golden crown,
Forge me a golden ring;
I'll be married with this crown
I'll become engaged with this ring
In front of the holy lectern. '”

“How can I sing, my dear little friends?
My darling sweetheart is far away;
It's my lot to die
In solitary grief.
A year has gone by — there's no news;
He doesn’t write to me;
Ah! But the world is beautiful only because of him,
My heart beats only because of him ...
Or don't you ever think about me?
Where are you, in what country?
Where is your home?
I pray and shed tears!
Alleviate my sorrow,
Comforting angel.”

Here in the svetlitsa a table is covered
With a white shroud;
And a minor and candle
Are on this table;
Two place settings are on the table.
“Tell your fortune, Svetlana;
At midnight, without any lies,
You'll find out what your lot will be.
When you look into the pure glass of the mirror,
Your sweetheart will knock at the door
With a light hand;
The bolt will fall from the door;
He will sit up at his place
To sup with you.”

There’s the beauty all alone;
She sits down at the mirror;
With hidden shyness she
Looks into the mirror:
It’s dark in the mirror; deathly
Silence is all around;
In a quivering flame the candle
Barely pours out its radiance;
Fear makes her breast tremble,
She’s scared to look behind her,
Fear clouds her eyes ...
The little flame crackles,
And a cricket, the midnight messenger,
Dolorously cried out.

Propped up on her elbow,
Svetlana is barely breathing ...
There ... someone knocked lightly
With the lock — she listens;
Timidly, she looks into the mirror:
It seemed as if someone’s bright
Eyes were gleaming
Behind her shoulders ...
Fear took her breath away ...
Suddenly a sound reaches her —
A quiet, light whisper:
“I am with you, my beauty;
The heavens have been tamed,
Your murmur has been heard!”

She looked back ... her sweetheart
Stretched his arms out to her.
“My joy, light of my eyes,
For us there will be no more reparation.
Let us ride! the priest is already waiting in the church
With the deacons and deaconesses;
The choir is singing a wedding song;
The church glows in candlelight.”
A sweet look was her answer;
They go to the wide courtyard,
To the wooden gates;
Their sleigh awaits them near the gates;
The horses are impatiently tearing away
Their silken bridles.

They got in ... All the horses took off at once;
Their nostrils give off smoke;
A blizzard rose up from their hooves
Over the sleigh.
They gallop ... everything is deserted all around;
Svetlana sees the steppe,
The moon is a misty circle;
The glades barely shine.
Her prophetic heart trembles
The maid timidly says:
“Why have you grown silent, my darling?”
With not even a word does he answer her:
He looks at the moonlight
Pale and despondent.

The horses hurry along the knolls;
They trample the deep snow ...
There, off to the side, the lonely
Temple of God is visible;
A whirlwind opened the doors;
A crowd of people are in the church;
The bright light of the chandeliers
Grows dim from the incense;
A black coffin is in the middle;
And the priest drawls out:
“Be taken by the grave!”
More than ever the maiden trembles;
The horses go by; her sweetheart is silent,
Pale and despondent.

Suddenly they were surrounded by a snowstorm;
The snow is falling heavily in tufts;
A black raven, with wings whistling,
Hovers over the sleigh;
The raven caws: grief! 
The hurried horses
Keenly look into the dark distance,
While lifting their manes;
A little flame glimmers in the field;
A quiet little corner was visible,
A little hut buried under the snow.

The swift steeds hurried off even faster,
Ploughing up the snow while running
Right up to it, all of them together.
They went tearing along ... and in a flash
They disappeared from view:
It was as if the horses, sled and
Bridegroom never existed at all.
All alone, in the dark,
Abandoned by her sweetheart,
The young maid is in a terrible spot;
A storm, a blizzard surrounds her.
She can’t turn back — there are no traces ...
She sees a light in the cottage:
Here she crosses herself;
While saying a prayer she knocks at the door ...
The door shakes ... it squeaks ...
And opens quietly.

What’s this? ... There’s a coffin in the cottage;
It's covered with a white linen cloth;
The Savior’s face shows at its foot;
A small candle burns before the icon ...
Ah! Svetlana, what’s wrong with you?
In whose dwelling place did you find yourself?
The mute inhabitant of the empty
Hut was dreadful.
She enters all atremble, all in tears;
She fell into the dust before the icon,
And prayed to the Savior.
And with a cross in her hand,
Under the saints in the corner
She hid timidly.

Everything grew still ... no more blizzard ...
The candle smolders weakly,
Sometimes it sheds a trembling light
Sometimes it darkens ...
Everything is in a deep dead sleep,
A dreadful silence ...
Hark, Svetlana! ... There is a
Light murmur in the silence.
Then she looks: a bright-eyed dove,
White as snow,
Quietly fluttering,
Flew to her in the corner;
It quietly settled on her breast
And embraced her with its wings.

Again it’s quiet all around ...
Then it seems to Svetlana
That under the white linen
The corpse is stirring ...
The pall fell away; the corpse
(His face is gloomier than the night)
Is now completely visible — he has a wreath upon his brow.
His eyes are shut
Suddenly ... his closed lips groan;
He tries to slide
His cold hands apart ...
But how’s the young maid? ... She is trembling ...
Her end is near ... but
The little white dove is not sleeping.

It roused itself, it unfolded
Its light wings;
It flew off to the corpse’s chest ...
Deprived of all of his strength,
He groaned and then began
To gnash his teeth dreadfully
And began to shine his terrible eyes
Upon the young maid ...
Again his lips were pale;
And his eyes rolled back to reveal their white sides,
Death was depicted ...
Look, Svetlana ... O Creator!
The corpse is her dear sweetheart!
Ah! ... then she woke up.

Where am I? — She’s all alone
In the svetlitsa near the mirror;
The light of dawn is shining
Through the thin curtains of the window;
A noisy rooster is beating its wings,
Meeting the day with its song;
Everything sparkles ... Svetlana’s spirit
Is troubled by the dream.
“Ah! What a horrible, terrible dream!
It bodes no good —
Only a bitter fate;
Secret gloom of days to come,
What do you promise my soul,
Joy or grief?”

Svetlana sat down near the window
(Her breast ached terribly);
From the window the wide road
Is visible through the mist;
The snow gleams under the sun,
A fine steam grows crimson ...
Hark! ... a resonant bell
Thunders in the empty distance;
Snowy powder lies on the road;
Zealous horses and a sleigh
Are rushing along, as if on wings;
Closer, look, they’re already at the gates;
A stately guest goes to the porch ...
Who? Svetlana's fiancé.

Svetlana, then was your dream
A prophet of torment?
Your sweetheart is with you; he’s still the same
After the test of separation;
The very same love is in his eyes,
As are the very same pleasant glances;
The very same dear speeches
Are on his sweet lips.
Open up, temple of God;
Loyal vows,
You fly up to the heavens;
Gather, young and old;
After you clink your ringing cups, sing
In harmony: many years to them!

My beauty, smile
Upon my ballad;
There are many marvels in it
But very little sense.
Your gaze makes me happy,
And I don’t want glory;
They taught us that glory is smoke;
The world is a sly judge.
Here's the meaning of my ballad:
“Our best friend in this life
Is faith in God’s providence.
The law of the Creator is good:
Here unhappiness is a false dream;
Happiness is the awakening.”

Oh, you, my Svetlana,
Don’t be aware of these dreadful dreams ...
Creator, may you be her shelter!
Don’t let the wound of sorrow
Or the shadow of passing sadness
Ever concern her;
Her soul is like a clear day;
Ah! let the hand of calamity
Rush right past her;
May her whole life be as bright
As the pleasant lustre
Of a little stream in the lap of a meadow;
May all the gaiety that was hers in the past
Be the friend of her days.
