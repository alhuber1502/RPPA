The Roses of Saadi

This morning I had planned to bring you roses,
But I tried to tie so many in my sashes
That they could not be contained and fell from me.

The knots were broken and the roses all were borne
By swirls of wind, and never will return.
Following the water they floated out to sea.

The waves turned red as if they were in flames.
This evening still my dress is all perfumes.
Come breathe them in: a fragrant memory.
