To the River Otter

Dear native brook! wild streamlet of the west! 
How many various-fated years have past,
 What blissful and what anguished hours, since last
 I skimmed the smooth thin stone along thy breast,
 Numbering its light leaps! Yet so deep impressed
 Sink the sweet scenes of childhood, that mine eyes
 I never shut amid the sunny blaze,
 But straight with all their tints thy waters rise –
 Thy crossing-plank, thy margin’s willowy maze,
 And bedded sand that veined with various dyes
 Gleamed through thy bright transparence to the gaze! 
Visions of childhood! oft have ye beguiled
 Lone manhood’s cares, yet waking fondest sighs:
 Ah, that I were once more a careless child!
