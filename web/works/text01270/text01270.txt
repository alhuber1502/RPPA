To the Sea

Farewell, free element!
Before me for the last time
Your blue waves roll
And you shine in proud beauty.

Like a friend’s dying words,
His cry in the last hour,
I have heard for the last time
Your moan, your cry, your lament.

My soul’s yearned-for home,
How often on your shores
I have wandered, gloomy, quiet,
Tormented by wild thoughts!

How I love your echoes, your dim
Whispering boom, the voice
Of the deep, the evening calm,
And your capricious blasts!

By some whim you choose
To cherish the fisherman’s
Humble sail, and it scuds bravely;
But suddenly you grow moody
And devour a whole fleet.

Something has held me back
From quitting forever
The safety of your shore,
From sailing out with rapture
And poetic flight!

You waited, called ... I was chained down;
My soul struggled for freedom,
In vain; I stayed on your banks
As if a spell was cast around me ...

Yet where could I have gone?
What is there to regret?
One isle alone in all your wilderness
Might still move my soul:

One cliff, the sepulchre of glory ...
There, majestic memories subsided
Into chill sleep; the flame
Of Napoleon went out.

And following in his wake,
Like the roar of thunder after lightning,
Another genius fled from us,
Another emperor of the mind.

Byron vanished, mourned by freedom,
Leaving us his garland.
Rage, ocean, tempest-stirred,
At the death of your singer.

Your image was stamped on him,
He was created by your spirit.
Like you, he was powerful, gloomy, deep;
Like you, nothing could daunt him.

The world has grown empty ... Where
Could you now carry me, O sea?
Enlightenment or tyranny
Have the same iron grip
Wherever virtue quickens.

Farewell, then. I shall not forget
Your triumphant beauty, and long,
Long I shall hear your thunder
In the evening hours.

I shall bear, into the forests
And silent wildernesses, your crags
And creeks, and the glitter and shadow
And murmur of your waves.
