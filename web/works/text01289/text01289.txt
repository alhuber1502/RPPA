I have built, though not in stone ...

I have built, though not in stone, a monument to myself;
The path that leads to it will not be overgrown;
Indomitably, the summit of my monument rises
Higher than Alexander’s Column.

Not all of me shall die — for by my sacred lyre
My soul shall outlive my dust, it shall escape decay —
In the sublunary world my fame shall be unending
As long as a single poet holds sway.

And word of me shall spread through all the Russian lands,
My name shall be pronounced in all its living tongues,
By proud Slav race and Finn, by steppe-frequenting Kalmuck,
And by the far-flung tribe of Tungus.

Long will there be a place for me in people’s hearts,
Because in our harsh age I sang of Liberty,
Because my lyre awakened noble sentiments
And, for the fallen, Charity.

Always, my Muse, be obedient to the Will of God,
Let praise and calumny weigh equally to the soul,
Have no fear of insult, seek no laurel-crown,
And do not argue with a fool.
