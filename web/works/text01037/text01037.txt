Conversation in the Forest

The hour is late, the eve grows cold,
Why ride you here alone so bold?
The woodland’s wide, I’ll be your guide
And lead you home, you lovely bride!

“Man’s cunning and deceit are great;
Crushed is my heart beneath grief’s weight.
The hunting horn roams to and fro.
O flee! My name you do not know.”

Your splendid steed, your dazzling dress,
Your body's young seductiveness -
I know you now! God hear my cry!
You are the sorceress Lorelei!

« You speak the truth — a castle’s mine
That towers high above the Rhine.
The hour is late, cold grows the eve,
This forest you shall never leave!”
