Awakening

Zephyr scatters the last shreds of sleep
From eyes sealed fast by dreams.
But I am not wakened to happiness
By Zephyr's quiet wings.
Neither the sweetness of rosy light,
Apollo's morning herald
Nor the soft blue of heaven’s face,
Nor smells borne from the fields,
Nor the swift flight of my brave horse
On the slant velvet lawns,
The hounds’ call and the song of horns
Around the desolate bay —
Nothing can bring cheer to my soul,
My soul alarmed by dreams;
Proud reason cannot still the voice
Of love with its cold words.
