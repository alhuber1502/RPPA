Sappho and Phaon

[Sonnet XXIII. — Sappho’s Conjectures]

To Etna’s scorching sands my Phaon flies! 
False youth, can other charms attractive prove? 
Say, can Sicilian loves thy passions move,
 Play round thy heart and fix thy fickle eyes,
 While in despair the Lesbian Sappho dies? 
Has spring for thee a crown of poppies wove,
 Or dost thou languish in the Idalian grove,
 Whose altar kindles, fanned by lovers’ sighs? 
Ah, think that while on Etna’s shores you stray,
 A fire, more fierce than Etna’s, fills my breast;
 Nor deck Sicilian nymphs with garlands gay
 While Sappho’s brows with cypress wreaths are dressed –
 Let one kind word my weary woes repay,
 Or, in eternal slumbers bid them rest.
