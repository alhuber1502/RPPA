By Derwent’s Rapid Stream

By Derwent’s rapid stream as oft I strayed
 With infancy’s light step and glances wild,
 And saw vast rocks on steepy mountains piled
 Frown o’er the umbrageous glen, or pleased surveyed
 The cloudy moonshine in the shadowy glade,
 Romantic Nature to the enthusiast child
 Grew dearer far than when serene she smiled
 In uncontrasted loveliness arrayed. 
But oh! in every scene, with sacred sway
 Her graces fire me; from the bloom that spreads
 Resplendent in the lucid morn of May,
 To the green light the little glow-worm sheds
 On mossy banks when midnight glooms prevail,
 And softest silence broods o’er all the dale.
