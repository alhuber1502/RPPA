To Mr. Victor Hugo

Happy is he whose soul in easy flight
Subjects a docile language to his thought,
Who does not feel his voice die in his throat,
Nor an impotent lyre escape his hands,
And seeking music where his soul expands,
Need never curse a recalcitrant note!
Not I, alas ... My verse has never throbbed,
Like my heart, with a cry of liberty;
Its graceful rhythm, its regular stream,
Have never rendered my thought as I had hoped;
My eyes’ real tears could never, when I sobbed,
Moisten the songs of my effusive vein;
Sometimes, deluded with a distant dream,
I have longed to attempt that lofty realm
Where our eagles, gathered in an azure sky,
Trace widening circles with fearless wing;
But my hesitant wing, when it tries to fly,
Cannot close its curve without wavering;
My flight always tends toward its earthly home,
And at day’s bright light I lower my eye.
