Rima XIV

A glimpse of you and, adrift before my eyes,
like the floating blind spot ringed with flames
that lingers after staring at the sun,
the image of your eyes remained.

Wherever I fix my gaze,
again I see those pupils flash
but I never find you, just your eyes,
those eyes, your gaze, peering back.

I watch them in a corner of my room
aglow there, phantasmal and free
in my sleep I can feel them still,
hovering wide open over me.

I know there are will-oâ€™-the-wisps that lure
wayfarers to their deaths in the night;
I feel the pull of your eyes
but where they take me I know not.
