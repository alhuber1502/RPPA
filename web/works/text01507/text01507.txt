Waterbead ecstasy: dying in a stream ...

Waterbead ecstasy: dying in a stream;
Too strong a pain brings its own balm.

So weak now we weep sighs only;
Learn surely how water turns to air.

Spring cloud thinning after rain:
Dying into its own weeping.

Would you riddle the miracle of the windâ€™s shaping?
Watch how a mirror greens in spring.

Rose, Ghalib, the rose changes gives us our joy in seeing.
All colors and kinds, what is should and be open always.
