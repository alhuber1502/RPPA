How can I See the Splendor of the Moon ...

How can I see the splendor of the moon
 If his face shines over my heart,
 Flaming like the sun? 

The Turks in his eyes charge through my soul,
 While untrue curling hair
 Defeats faith. 

Yet if he lifted the veil from his face,
 The world would be undone,
 The universe astounded. 

He walks through the garden
 With grace, erect,
 His exquisite posture mocking even the straight cypresses. 

He charges, riding his gnostic horse
 Into the holy space of divinity,
 The sacred sphere. 

Tonight the Saki with its red-stained ruby lips
 Pours wine for the luxury of every drunk,
 And sates every revelerâ€™s taste. 

As Hayati has drunk his ecstasy,
 Her soul now satisfied by the wine of his pure heart,
 How can she drink any other nectar?
