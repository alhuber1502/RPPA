Pleasure in Death

Before he sinks into the dark blue stream
The death-drunk swan sings in his dream;
Earth, summer-weary, as its flowers go,
Leaves all its fire to grapes to make them glow;
Sun, emitting flashes as it sinks,
Once more gives out its glow which earth now drinks,
Until, to clasp the drunk one near and far,
Wondrous night arises star by star.
