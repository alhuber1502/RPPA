The Prophet

I wandered in a lonely place;
My soul’s great thirst tormented me, —
And at a crossing of the ways
A six-winged seraph came to me.
Like slumber, fingers light and wise
He laid upon my weary eyes:
And like an eagle’s in amaze
They opened with all-seeing gaze.
My ears he touched, — from all around,
Into them poured noise and sound:
I heard the heavens in commotion,
And angel hosts’ celestial flight,
And sea-beasts stirring in the ocean,
And vine growth on the valley-side.
And to my lips he bent, tore out
My tongue, a base and sinful thing;
With bloody hand, in my numb mouth
He placed a serpent’s subtle sting.
And with his sword he clove my breast,
And took my trembling heart entire;
A coal alight with brilliant fire
Into my opened breast he thrust.
In that lone place I lay as dead,
And God’s voice called to me, and said:
“Prophet, arise, behold, and hearken,
And through the world, by sea and land,
Go, and fulfil my will unshaken,
burn with my Word the heart of man.”
