Autumn

Welcome, woods crowned with sparse remains of green,
Yellowing leafage scattered bn the lawn!
Last fine dare, welcome! such a dismal scene
Pleases my taste — is fit for those who mourn!

I trace the lone path with a pensive tread;
I love – for the last time – to see again
This pale sun struggling, where I walk, to shed
Its feeble light into the dusky glen!

Yes, in these autumn days, when Nature dies,
Her fading glances rather gladden me —
A friend’s last greeting, the last smile to rise
On lips that death will close eternally!

So, grieving for lost hopes of longer days,
As I am drawing near life’s boundary-line
I turn once more, and with an envious gaze
I view the blessings that were never mine.

Earth, sun, vales — Nature, fair and marvellous —
I mourn you from the margin of the tomb;
To dying eyes, the sun is glorious!
The light is pure! the air has such perfume!

Now I would rather empty to the last
This drink of mixed ambrosia and gall!
In the cup where I drained life in the past,
Could drops of honey linger affer all?

Perhaps, stored in the future, might still be
Some happiness when hope has all gone by;
Within the crowd, a soul unknown to me
Might understand my soul, and might reply. ...

The falling blossom leaves the breeze her scent;
To life, to sunlight, that is her farewell;
I too die; and my soul, as it is spent,
Breathes out like some melodious mournful knell.
