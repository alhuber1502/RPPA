Jock of Hazeldean

“Why weep ye by the tide, ladie?
Why weep ye by the tide?
I'll wed ye to my youngest son,
And ye sail be his bride:
And ye sail be his bride, ladie,
Sae comely to be seen” —
But aye she loot the tears sown fa’
For Jock of Hazeldean.

“Now let this wilfu’ grief be done,
And dry that cheek so pale;
Young Frank is chief of Errington,
And lord of Fangley-dale;
His step is first in peaceful ha’
His sword in battle keen” —
But aye she loot the tears down fa’
For Jock of Hazeldean.

“A chain of gold you sail not lack,
Nor braid to bind your hair;
Nor mettled hound, nor managed hawk,
Nor palfrey fresh and fair;
And you, the foremost o’ them a*,
Shall ride our forest queen” —
But aye she loot the tears down fa*
For Jock of Hazeldean.

The kirk was deck’d at morning-tide,
The tapers glimmer’d fair;
The priest and bridegroom wait the bride,
And dame and knight are there.
They sought her baith by bower and ha’;
The ladie was not seen!
She’s o’er the Border and awa’
Wi’ Jock of Hazeldean.
