The Troubadour.

 Romance.

The troubadour goes lonely
on a bleak forest path,
tamed and subdued by wrath
of Fortune only.

His face, one day so fair,
is showing sorrow’s wrongs,
and, ah, the singer s songs
no more are there.

In secret love too long,
unwisely he at last
unburdened all his breast
in a love song.

From the far nuptial room
his lord heard soon his plight,
and he that very night
sang his own doom.

For the young singer’ fate
trembled the lady’s breast,
who until then possessed
no love so great.

Begging her jealous sire,
she checked his wrath immense:
and her sweet innocence
roused his desire.

And so she smiled, naïve,
as her sweet lord caressed her;
but the young hapless jester
had soon to leave.

No more was he to be
those fatal eyes before,
and drown in them no more
his misery.

He crossed those courtyards, mute,
which once his songs had filled
with tales of battlefield
upon his lute.

Through the last door he passed;
stopped, looked once more at it:
and his heart seemed to beat
its very last.

The troubadour found, lonely,
to these dark woods his way,
and shuns each shining ray,
save the moon’s only.

His cheeks, one day so fair,
look like two flowers no more:
his songs that used to soar
no more are there.
