The drop dies in the river ...

The drop dies in the river  
of its joy
pain goes so far it cures itself

in the spring after the heavy rain the cloud
disappears
that was nothing but tears

in the spring the mirror turns green
  holding a miracle
Change the shining wind

the rose led us to our eyes

let whatever is be open
