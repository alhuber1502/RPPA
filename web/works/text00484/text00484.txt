The Prelude

[Book IX., ll. 161-180]

’Twas in truth an hour
 Of universal ferment; mildest men
 Were agitated, and commotions, strife
 Of passion and opinion, filled the walls
 Of peaceful houses with unquiet sounds. 
The soil of common life was, at that time,
 Too hot to tread upon. Oft said I then,
 And not then only, ‘What a mockery this
 Of history, the past and that to come! 
Now do I feel how all men are deceived,
 Reading of nations and their works, in faith,
 Faith given to vanity and emptiness;
 Oh! laughter for the page that would reflect
 To future times the face of what now is!’ 
The land all swarmed with passion, like a plain
 Devoured by locusts, – Carra, Gorsas, – add
 A hundred other names, forgotten now,
 Nor to be heard of more; yet, they were powers,
 Like earthquakes, shocks repeated day by day,
 And felt through every nook of town and field.
