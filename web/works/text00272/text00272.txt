Old Meg She Was a Gypsy

Old Meg she was a gypsy,
 And lived upon the moors,
 Her bed it was the brown heath-turf,
 And her house was out-of-doors. 

Her apples were swart blackberries,
 Her currants pods o’ broom,
 Her wine was dew of the white wild rose,
 Her book a churchyard tomb. 

Her brothers were the craggy hills,
 Her sisters larchen trees –
 Alone with her great family
 She lived as she did please. 

No breakfast had she many a morn,
 No dinner many a noon,
 And ‘stead of supper she would stare
 Full hard against the moon. 

For every morn, of woodbine fresh
 She made a garlanding,
 And every night the dark glen yew
 She wove – and she would sing! 

And with her fingers old and brown
 She plaited mats o’ rushes,
 And gave them to the cottagers
 She met among the bushes. 

Old Meg she was brave as Margaret Queen
 And tall as Amazon,
 An old red blanket-cloak she wore,
 A chip-hat had she on –
 God rest her ag
                ed
               bones somewhere,
 She died full long agone!
