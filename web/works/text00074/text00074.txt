There Was a Boy

There was a boy – ye knew him well, ye cliffs
 And islands of Winander – many a time
 At evening, when the stars had just begun
 To move along the edges of the hills,
 Rising or setting, would he stand alone
 Beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake,
 And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands
 Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth
 Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,
 Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,
 That they might answer him. And they would shout
 Across the watery vale, and shout again,
 Responsive to his call, with quivering peals,
 And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud,
 Redoubled and redoubled – a wild scene
 Of mirth and jocund din. And when it chanced
 That pauses of deep silence mocked his skill,
 Then sometimes in that silence, while he hung
 Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise
 Has carried far into his heart the voice
 Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene
 Would enter unawares into his mind
 With all its solemn imagery – its rocks,
 Its woods, and that uncertain heaven – received
 Into the bosom of the steady lake.
