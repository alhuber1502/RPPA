The River Duddon

Afterthought

I thought of thee, my partner and my guide,
 As being past away. Vain sympathies –
 For backward, Duddon, as I cast my eyes,
 I see what was, and is, and will abide. 
Still glides the stream, and shall forever glide
 (The form remains, the function never dies),
 While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise –
 We men, who in our morn of youth defied
 The elements – must vanish. Be it so! 
Enough if something from our hands have power
 To live, and act, and serve the future hour;
 And if, as toward the silent tomb we go,
 Through love, through hope, and faith’s transcendent dower
 We feel that we are greater than we know.
