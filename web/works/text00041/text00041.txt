The Faithless Knight

The lady she sat in her bower alone,
 And she gazed from the lattice-window high
 Where a white steed’s hoofs were ringing on,
 With a beating heart, and a smothered sigh. 
Why doth she gaze through the sunset-rays? 
Why doth she watch that white steed’s track,
 While a quivering smile on her red lip plays? 
’Tis her own dear knight – will he not look back? 

The steed flew fast, and the rider passed –
 Nor paused he to gaze at the lady’s bower –
 The smile from her lip is gone at last! 
There are tears on her cheek, like the dew on a flower! 
And ‘Plague on these foolish tears’, she said,
 ‘Which have dimmed the view of my young love’s track! 
For oh, I am sure, while I bent my head,
 It was then – it was then – that my knight looked back!’ 

On flew that steed with an arrow’s speed –
 He is gone, and the green boughs wave between –
 And she sighs, as the sweet breeze sighs through a reed,
 As she watches the spot where he last has been. 
Oh, many a sun shall rise and set,
 And many an hour may she watch in vain,
 And many a tear shall that soft cheek wet,
 Ere that steed and its rider return again!
