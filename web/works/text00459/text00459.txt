A Secret Power over You Has Been Given to Me ...

A secret power has been given to me over you,
 The power of a fatal star. 
There is a legend – you yourself are full of legends –
 So listen: it happens sometimes,
 That an unknown star will suddenly light up the skies,
 In the midst of the assembly of luminaries,
 And the Lord appointed it to shine brightly,
 But this is a falling star ... 
And, whether it burnt itself out by an impure fire,
 Or, being alien to the stellar circle,
 Was thrown down from heaven by seraphs, –
 It is disintegrating to dust;
 And, they say, it has been ordained that this somber star
 will plant a certain temptation,
 and evil dreams, and suffering,
 wherever those fatal pieces fall. 

A secret power has been given to me over you,
 A power I have known for a long time:
 Like a wave carries a vessel away from a harbor
 Into a boundless sea,
 So a thunderstorm, tears a leaf away from a tree,
 And spins it in a whirlwind of dust,
 And the eyes, following it with compassion, will not see
 Where it is spinning around, where it is flying ... 
A secret power has been given to me over you,
 And it is destined that I will carry you away
 And even though you are proud and secretive,
 I have known this power from long ago.
