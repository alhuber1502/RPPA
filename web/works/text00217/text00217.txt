To My Brother

Oh transient sorrows, light as morning dews
 Chased with soon-rising beams –
 Yet oft sick fancy deems
 Portents of ill they came, since care’s worn hues
 O’ercast thy sister’s cheek, where stands a tear
 Unheeded or forgotten now
 Like cold drops on the pallid brow
 Of pain or fear. 
When, when wilt thou return? 
Since thou art far away,
 Each desolated day
 Has brought me much to mourn –
 And oh, my brother, if thou long shouldst roam,
 To her who loves thee best thou never wilt come home!
