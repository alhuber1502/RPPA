I do not know what it means ...

I do not know what it means that
I am so sadly inclined;
There is an old tale and its scenes that
Will not depart from my mind.

The air is cool and darkling,
And peaceful flows the Rhine;
The mountain top is sparkling,
The setting sunbeams shine.

The fairest maid is reclining
In wondrous beauty there;
Her golden jewels are shining,
She combs her golden hair.

With a golden Comb she is combing,
And sings a song so free.
It casts a spell on the gloaming,
A magical melody.

The boatman listens, and o’er him
Wild-aching passions roll;
He sees but the maiden before him,
He sees not reef or shoal.

I think, at last the wave swallows
The boat and the boatman’s cry;
And this is the fate that follows
The song of the Lorelei.
