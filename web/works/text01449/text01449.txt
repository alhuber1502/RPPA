Every man has his sorrows ...

Every man has his sorrows; yet each still   
Hides under a calm forehead his own will. 
  Each pities but himself. Each in his grief
   Envies his neighbor: he too seeks relief;
 For one man’s pain is of no other known:   
They hide their sorrows as he hides his own;
 And each, with tears and aching heart, can sigh:
 All other men are happy, but not I. 
They are unhappy all. They, desolate,
 Cry against heaven and bid heaven change their fate. 
  Their fate is changed; they soon, with fresh tears, know   
They have but changed one for another woe.
