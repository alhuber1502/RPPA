The Fifth of May.

 Ode

He’s dead. Just as his body,
his breathing ended, lay
oblivious, immobile,
bereft of its great day,
so at this news mankind
lies thunderstruck and stunned,

musing upon the final
hour of the man of fate,
unsure if a new, mortal
footprint will soon or late
appear within our midst,
treading his sanguine dust.

My poet’s fancy saw him
bright on a throne one day;
but when through varied fortune
he fell, and rose, and lay,
I did not blend my song
With thousands of the throng.

Virgin to servile homage
and cowardly offense,
roused by the sudden setting
of all that light immense,
now on his urn I cast
a paean that may last.

From Pyramids to Alps, from
the Tagus to the Rhine,
he bade the lightning follow
his more resplendent sign:
From Don to Scylla, he
Thundered from sea to sea.

True glory? Let the future
its hard pronouncement give:
we bow to his Creator,
Who did more deeply leave
in one man’s life and death
the imprint of His breath.

The restlessness and tempest
of a most daring plan,
the sureness of a kingdom
that bends a tameless man
(he grabs it, to attain
what hope had deemed insane):

all he experienced — after
the peril glory’s height,
retreat and then new triumph,
the throne, the exile’s plight:
twice trodden in the mud
and twice adored as God.

He named himself: two centuries
fighting each other still,
looked up to him, submissive,
heeding as fate his will:
commanding quietude,
between them, judge, he stood.

And then he vanished, ending
his days on a brief shore —
a sign of boundless envy
and pity still at war,
of unabated hate
and love defying fate.

As on a shipwrecked seaman
the whirling waves weigh deep,
the waves above whose summit
he could until now keep
his glance, eager to gain
a distant land in vain:

so on that soul the burden
of recollections fell.
How oft to future ages
he wished his life to tell,
but, as his fingers shook,
he closed his endless book!

How often in the silent
death of a dismal day,
his arms inertly folded,
his gaze without its ray,
he stood within the blast
of his remembered past!

Again he saw the mobile
tents, the assaulted meads,
the lightning of the squadrons,
the rushing waves of steeds,
the signal for advance,
the fast obedience.

Maybe by all this torment
his peaceless soul was driven,
ah, to despair; but quickly
a valid hand from heaven
lifted him, kind and fair,
to a more healthy air.

Along hope’s flowered meadows
it taught him then to go
towards everlasting prairies
where higher prizes glow,
where glory that was bright
is silent dark of night.

Deathless and beauteous, balmy
Faith, used to victories!
Write this down, too: be joyous
for never did a prouder
grandeur stoop down to see
the shame of Calvary.

You, all malicious murmur
ban from his poor remains:
that God who strikes and comforts,
Who weakens and sustains,
near the forsaken pall
came down to rest and call.
