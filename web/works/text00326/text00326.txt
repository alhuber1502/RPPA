‘Child of My Parents’

[Prelude Book XIII., ll. 211-246]

Child of my parents, sister of my soul,
 Elsewhere have strains of gratitude been breathed
 To thee for all the early tenderness
 Which I from thee imbibed. And true it is
 That later seasons owed to thee no less;
 For, spite of thy sweet influence and the touch
 Of other kindred hands that opened out
 The springs of tender thought in infancy,
 And spite of all which singly I had watched
 Of elegance, and each minuter charm
 In Nature and in life, still to the last –
 Even to the very going-out of youth,
 The period which our story now has reached –
 I too exclusively esteemed that love,
 And sought that beauty, which (as Milton sings)
 Has terror in it. Thou didst soften down
 This over-sternness; but for thee, sweet friend,
 My soul, too reckless of mild grace, had been
 Far longer what by nature it was framed –
 Longer retained its countenance severe –
 A rock with torrents roaring, with the clouds
 Familiar, and a favourite of the stars;
 But thou didst plant its crevices with flowers,
 Hang it with shrubs that twinkle in the breeze,
 And teach the little birds to build their nests
 And warble in its chambers. 
At a time
 When Nature, destined to remain so long
 Foremost in my affections, had fallen back
 Into second place, well pleased to be
 A handmaid to a nobler than herself –
 When every day brought with it some new sense
 Of exquisite regard for common things,
 And all the earth was budding with these gifts
 Of more refined humanity – thy breath,
 Dear sister, was a kind of gentler spring
 That went before my steps.
