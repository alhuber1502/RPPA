Pale star of evening ...

Pale star of evening, messenger from afar,
Whose face emerges brilliant from western veils,
From your azure palace, embosomed in the sky,
What do you gaze at in the plain?

The storm passes away, and the winds are calmed,
The forest, quivering, weeps on the heather,
The golden phalaena, in her light path,
Flits across the perfumed fields.

What do you seek on the sleeping earth?
But already you sink toward the mountains;
You flee while smiling, melancholic friend,
And your trembling gaze is nearly effaced.

Star descending toward the green hilltop,
Sad silver tear from the mantle of Night,
You whom the shepherd watches from afar,
While step by step his long flock follows him, —

Star, where are you going in this immense night?
Are you seeking a bed with the reeds on the shore?
Where are you going, so lovely, at this silent hour,
To drop like a pearl into the sea’s deep breast?

Ah! if you must die, lovely star, and if your head
Is to plunge its blond hair into the vast sea,
Before leaving us, for just an instant stop; —
Star of love, do not descend from the heavens!
