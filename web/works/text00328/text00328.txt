She Was a Phantom of Delight

She was a phantom of delight
 When first she gleamed upon my sight;
 A lovely apparition, sent
 To be a moment’s ornament;
 Her eyes as stars of twilights fair;
 Like twilights, too, her dusky hair;
 But all things else about her drawn
 From May-time and the cheerful dawn;
 A dancing shape, an image gay,
 To haunt, to startle, and way-lay. 

I saw her upon nearer view,
 A spirit, yet a woman too! 
Her household motions light and free,
 And steps of virgin liberty;
 A countenance in which did meet
 Sweet records, promises as sweet;
 A creature not too bright or good
 For human nature’s daily food;
 For transient sorrows, simple wiles,
 Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles. 

And now I see with eye serene
 The very pulse of the machine;
 A being breathing thoughtful breath;
 A traveller betwixt life and death;
 The reason firm, the temperate will,
 Endurance, foresight, strength and skill;
 A perfect woman; nobly planned,
 To warn, to comfort, and command;
 And yet a spirit still, and bright
 With something of an angel light.
