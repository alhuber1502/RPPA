Autumn Landscape

Drop by drop rain slaps the banana leaves. 
Praise whoever sketched this desolate scene:
 the lush, dark canopies of the gnarled trees,
 the long river, sliding smooth and white. 
I lift my wine flask, drunk with rivers and hills. 
My backpack, breathing moonlight, sags with poems. 
Look, and love everyone. 
Whoever sees this landscape is stunned.
