19 October

Blessed is he who like Achilles, glorious,
Young and splendid, daring and majestic,
Fell in the midst of a life of victories,
Piled with an indestructible force!
Blessed! His face is always young,
Gleaming with an immortal grief,
Like an eternally golden sun,
Like the first fair dawn in Eden.

But I alone among an alien crowd
Helpless and decrepit in the night, stand
Over the gloomy tomb of my friends,
Over a terrible grave where hope is buried.
The last poet akin to me has fallen
Into this bottomless tomb, felled by lightning,
And here again on a sacred day of reunion,
No longer with us is our schoolmate Pushkin!

He will no longer bring any new songs
Nor will your bosoms tremble to their music.
Nor will he drink your health with a lifted glass:
He has soared away to friends in heaven.
He is feasting now with the poet Delvig
Now with Griboedov:
My soul is longing for them, for all of them
Greedily I stretch my arms to them!

And now my turn has come! Fate threatens me
With an unbearable blow — nothing is left.
It deprives me of that poetic gift
With which my soul was bound inseparably!
Through orphanhood, shame and deprivation,
Through years of exile and captivity
Under the shield of holy inspiration,
A divine spark always glowed within me.

And now! — Not a flame, no thunder or lightning
Has struck me down; no, I am stuck in mire,
Weighed down by grief, in poverty and despair,
And I have broken away from forgotten strings.
An angel of song created paradise once
From stifling darkness — golden, new.
But without him am I not a breathless corpse
Among those other corpses already cold and mute?
