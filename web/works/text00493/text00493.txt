Germany. A Winter’s Tale

III.

The bones of Carolus Magnus lie
 in Aachen cathedral (maybe a
 bit confusing, I don’t mean wee
 Karl Mayer, he lives in Swabia.) 

I wouldn’t much like to be buried, for all
 that splendid imperial shrining. 
I’d rather be living, even down there
 in Stuttgart, mis’rably rhyming. 

The Aachen dogs are so bored, their tails
 implore you with servile wagging. 
‘Give us a kick, o stranger, perhaps
 it’ll stop our interest flagging.’ 

I walked about in that boring hole
 for an hour or more together. 
I saw the Prussian soldiers again. 
They’re still the same as ever. 

Still the same grey coats, and still
 the high and blood-red collar
 (‘The red is for the Frenchies’ blood,’
 as Körner used to holler). 

They’re still a wooden pedantic lot,
 their movements still have the graces
 of a right-angled triangle. 
Arrogance freezes their faces. 

And still they strut about as stiff,
 as straight and thin as a candle,
 as if they’d swallowed the corporal’s stick
 Old Fritz knew how to handle. 

The stick has never quite been lost,
 although its use has been banned. 
Inside the glove of newer ways
 there’s still the old iron hand. 

The long moustache is the pigtail of old,
 transferred to a different place. 
The pigtail one hung down behind,
 now it droops from the face. 

The cavalry’s new get-up I quite
 approved – one must speak fairly –
 especially that spike of steel
 which crowns it all so squarely,

so redolent of derring-do,
 of knights in times Romantic,
 of Lady Jane of Falconmount
 and m’lords Fouque, Uhland, Tieck;

Of the good olde Middle Ages so fine,
 of pages and noble peers,
 who bore in their hearts a trust right true,
 and coats of arms on their rears. 

Crusade and tourney it conjures up,
 and serving a lady for guerdon,
 an age of faith without blessing of print,
 when newspapers hadn’t been heard on. 

Oh yes, I like the helmet, it proves
 the wit of the Lord’s Anointed! 
A royal jest it was indeed,
 most delicately pointed. 

It’s really only the thought of storms
 that I find a little fright’ning –
 that spike on your Romantic heads
 might attract some modern lightning. 

At Aachen I saw that bird I hate
 displayed on the staging sign;
 back at me he looked with an eye
 most poisonously malign. 

You ugly devil, just you wait,
 if ever I manage to catch you
 I’ll pluck out your feathers and hack off your claws
 and then as follows dispatch you:

I’ll set you up on top of a pole
 high in the air as a target,
 and all the Rhineland marksmen shall come
 for a jolly shooting party. 

The man who brings you down, I shall
 in person scepter-and-crown-him –
 the worthy fellow! A fanfare shall blow,
 and vivats shall ring all around him.
