The Lamb

Little lamb who made thee? 
Dost thou know who made thee,
 Gave thee life and bid thee feed
 By the stream and o’er the mead,
 Gave thee clothing of delight,
 Softest clothing woolly bright,
 Gave thee such a tender voice,
 Making all the vales rejoice! 
Little lamb who made thee,
 Dost thou know who made thee? 

Little lamb I’ll tell thee,
 Little lamb I’ll tell thee! 
He is call
                ed
               by thy name,
 For He calls himself a lamb;
 He is meek and He is mild,
 He became a little child. 
I a child and thou a lamb,
 We are call
                ed
               by his name –
 Little lamb God bless thee,
 Little lamb God bless thee!
