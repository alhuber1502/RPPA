The skylark sings ...

The skylark sings in my ear again!
A song I’d lost, though long since heard.
Sing on, for you announce the coming spring,
sing on, beloved little bird.

Oh god, how it refreshes me,
this song after the battle’s roar,
it comes like a cool mountain stream to bathe
the burtiing wound its waves restore.

Sing on, sing on, beloved bird,
your songs remind me I am not
only the soldier and agent of death I seem:
the poets’s still the man who fought.

Your song reminds, me of two things,
poetry is one, love the other,
and for each good that these two goddesses
have brought me they will bring another.

Memory and hope, these are
two rose-trees that are blooming still
out of your song, and as they bloom they bend
fine leaves over my kindled soul.

And then I dream, and all my dreams
are greatly dear and gently sweet ...
For it is you I dream of, my true angel,
you whom I truly love to greet

as the salvation of my soul,
given to me by God’s hands
to demonstrate that heaven is not up there
but down in these poor earthly lands.

Sing, skylark, sing, for all the flowers
have taken new life from your voice:
my heart that had been fallow is now filled
with hosts of flowers that rejoice.
