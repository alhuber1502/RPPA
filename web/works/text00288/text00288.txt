Fears in Solitude

[Ll. 90 – 93, 101 – 20]

We, this whole people, have been clamorous
 For war and bloodshed, animating sports
 The which we pay for, as a thing to talk of,
 Spectators and not combatants! 
Boys and girls,
 And women, that would groan to see a child
 Pull off an insect’s leg, all read of war,
 The best amusement for our morning meal! 
The poor wretch, who has learnt his only prayers
 From curses, who knows scarcely words enough
 To ask a blessing of his heavenly Father,
 Becomes a fluent phraseman, absolute
 And technical in victories and defeats,
 And all our dainty terms for fratricide,
 Terms which we trundle smoothly o’er our tongues
 Like mere abstractions, empty sounds to which
 We join no feeling and attach no form –
 As if the soldier died without a wound;
 As if the fibres of this godlike frame
 Were gored without a pang; as if the wretch,
 Who fell in battle doing bloody deeds,
 Passed off to Heaven, translated and not killed;
 As though he had no wife to pine for him,
 No God to judge him!
