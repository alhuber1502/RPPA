The Castle of Indolence Stanzas

[Ll. 37-72]

With him there often walked in friendly wise,
 Or lay upon the moss by brook or tree,
 A noticeable man with large dark eyes
 And a pale face, that seemed undoubtedly
 As if a blooming face it ought to be! 
Heavy his low-hung lip did oft appear
 (A face divine of heaven-born idiocy);
 Profound his forehead was, though not severe –
 Yet some did think that he had little business here. 

Ah, God forfend – his was a lawful right! 
Noisy he was, and gamesome as a boy;
 His limbs would toss about him with delight
 Like branches when strong winds the trees annoy. 
He lacked not implement, device or toy,
 To cheat away the hours that silent were;
 He would have taught you how you might employ
 Yourself, and many did to him repair –
 And certés, not in vain – he had inventions rare! 

Instruments had he, playthings for the ear
 (Long blades of grass, plucked round him as he lay,
 These served to catch the wind as it came near);
 Glasses he had with many colours gay –
 Others that did all little things display:
 The beetle with his radiance manifold
 (A mail
                ed
               angel on a battle day!) 
And leaves and flowers, and herbage green and gold,
 And all the glorious sights which fairies do behold. 

He would entice that other man to hear
 His music, and to view his imagery;
 And sooth, these two did love each other dear –
 As far as love in such a place could be! 
There did they lie, from earthly labour free,
 Most happy livers as were ever seen! 
If but a bird, to keep them company,
 Or butterfly sate down, they were, I ween,
 As pleased as if the same had been a Maiden Queen!
