My Little Bluebells

My little bluebells,
 Flowers of the steppe! 
Why do you look at me,
 You, azure ones? 
And what tinkle you about
 On a happy day of May,
 Nodding your heads,
 Amidst unmown grass? 

The steed carries me like an arrow
 Over the open field;
 He tramples you down underneath,
 Hits you with his hoof. 
My little bluebells,
 Flowers of the steppe! 
Pray curse me not,
 You, azure ones! 

I would be happy not to trample you down,
 Happy to rush along, passing you by,
 But one cannot restrain with a bridle
 This indomitable race! 
I fly, fly like an arrow,
 Only raising the dust;
 The dashing horse carries me, –
 But where? I know not! 

Untrained and ungroomed
 By a master rider,
 And hardened by blizzards,
 Thou hast grown in an open country;
 Thou hast no luxurious saddle-cloth
 That sparkles like fire,
 My horse, my Slavic horse,
 Wild and unruly! 

Steed, we have our freedom! 
Having left the cramped world behind,
 We fly in full career
 Towards an unknown goal. 
How will our ride end? 
In bliss? or in sorrow? 
It is not for man to know –
 Only God knows! 

Shall I fall down on the salty marsh
 To die of heat? 
Or shall an evil Kirghiz-Kaisak
 With shaved head,
 Hiding in the grass,
 Silently, bend his bow
 And suddenly overtake me
 With his brazen arrow? 

Or shall we dash into the radiant city
 With its regal kremlin? 
The streets sound marvelously
 With the chime of bells,
 And the people in the square,
 In noiseful expectation behold
 A serene embassy
 Coming from the west. 

Wearing caftans and doublets,
 With forelocks and mustaches,
 The guests ride their steeds,
 Waving their maces;
 With a proud port, line after line
 Marches majestically;
 The wind blows apart their sleeves
 Behind their backs. 

And the stately host
 Comes out on the porch,
 His radiant face
 Shines with a new glory;
 His look inspires
 Both love and fear in all,
 The Monomach’s Cap
 Glistens on his forehead. 

‘Bread and salt! And well met! –
 Says the sovereign. –
 Long have I awaited you, children,
 To come to the holy city!’ 
And they reply to him:
 ‘We are one blood,
 And we have looked to thee as our lord
 Since the days of yore!’ 

The bells chime louder,
 The gusli ring out,
 The guests are seated around the tables,
 Mead and beer flow freely,
 The uproar spreads far south
 To the Turk and the Hungarian –
 And the Slavic sound of clinking bowls
 Is not to the Germans’ liking. 

Hail ye, my little bluebells,
 Flowers of the steppe! 
Why do you look at me,
 You, azure ones? 
And what grieve ye about,
 On a happy May day,
 Nodding your heads,
 Amidst unmown grass?
