The Kiss in the Dream

The breath of life was brought me by a kiss,
It quieted my bosom’s deepest grief.
Come, Darkness, wrap me close in night’s relief,
That my dry lips may drink in my new bliss.

In dreams my life was all suffused with calm,
And so I live to contemplate my dreams;
I scorn all other joys, for all their gleams,
For only night can breathe out such sweet balm.

Love’s sweetest joys the day restrains for spite,
He hurts me with his vain and gaudy light,
His sun consumes me with its scorching fires.
So hide yourself, Eye, from its earthly beams!
Conceal yourself in night, it quiets your desires
And heals your hurt, like Lethe’s cooling streams.
