Scale Force, Cumberland

It sweeps, as sweeps an army
 Adown the mountain-side,
 With the voice of many thunders
 Like the battle’s sounding tide. 

Yet the sky is blue above it,
 And the dashing of the spray
 Wears the colour of the rainbow
 Upon an April day. 

It rejoices in the sunshine
 When after heavy rain
 It gathers the far waters
 To dash upon the plain. 

It is terrible yet lovely
 Beneath the morning rays,
 Like a dream of strength and beauty
 It haunted those who gaze. 

We feel that it is glorious –
 Its power is on the soul –
 And lofty thoughts within us
 Acknowledge its control. 

A generous inspiration
 Is on the outward world –
 It waketh thoughts and feelings
 In careless coldness furled. 

To love and to admire
 Seems natural to the heart;
 Life’s small and selfish interests
 From such a scene depart!
