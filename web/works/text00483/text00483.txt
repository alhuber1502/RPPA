Friend! in the Moment of Devastation

Friend! in the moment of devastation, your inner self covered with darkness,
 When in an abyss memory and premonition pass away,
 Your diffident thought gropes among shadowy figures and glow-worms,
 Your heart cannot sigh, your eye fails to weep,
 When from your night-dizzy soul the fire-wings fall
 And you fear yourself anew sinking down into Nothingness,
 Tell me, who saves you then? – Who is the friendly angel
 That to your inner self restores order and beauty,
 Builds your ruined world anew, raises the fallen
 Altar, lighting its candle with priestly hand? –
 Alone the powerful Being, who once out of eternal night
 Kissed the Seraph alive, woke the suns up to dance. 
Alone the holy word that made call to the worlds: ‘Become!’ –
 And in whose living force the worlds still ever move. 
Therefore, rejoice, friend! and sing in the darkness of despair:
 Night is the mother of day, chaos is neighbour with God.
