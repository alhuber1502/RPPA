Enthusiasm

Just as when the thunder-eagle
Carried Ganymede to the skies,
The boy, still clinging to the earth,
Struggled against the bird of the gods,
But the eagle, its rapid talons
Pressing into his timid flanks,
Wrested him off to the paternal fields,
And, deaf to his beseeching voice,
It threw him down, still quivering,
At the feet of the immortals,

So when you swoop upon my soul,
Enthusiasm, conquering eagle,
At the sound of your fiery wings
I tremble with a holy dread;
I struggle under your power,
I flee, I fear lest your presence
Will annihilate a mortal soul,
Like an inextinguishable fire
Lit by lightning, that burns up
The pyre, the altar, and the temple.

But the impulsive flight of thought
The instinct of sense resists in vain;
Under the god, my oppressed soul
Bounds, darts forth, and beats my breast.
The lightning goes round in my veins;
Thunderstruck with burning fire,
I incite it by fighting it,
And the lava of my genius
Overflows in streams of harmony,
And consumes me as it flees.

Muse, contemplate your victim!
That inspired brow exists no more,
That glance sublime no more exists
That once sent forth a sacred ray;
Under your devouring influence
Scarcely a remnant of my being
Has outlived my youthful days.
My brow, expunged by pallor,
Preserves no more than a faint trace
Of the lightning that once struck me.

Happy is the unfeeling poet!
His lute is never bathed in tears,
His unruffled enthusiasm
Never holds this tragic furor.
From his pure and fertile veins
Flow, numbered well and measured,
Rivulets of milk and honey;
And this Icarus, faint of heart,
Betrayed by Pindar’s soaring wing,
Will never fall down from the sky.

But we, to set souls ablaze,
Ourselves must burn, and we must snatch
From jealous heaven its triple flames.
To paint it all, we must feel it all.
Hearthfires burning with light,
Our hearts must concentrate
The rays of all of nature.
And they reproach our life!
But this torch that they begrudge us
Is lit by passionate fires.

No, a peaceful breast has never
Brought forth these sacred outbursts
Nor this sympathetic chaos
That subdues the world to our songs.
No, no, when Homer’s Apollo
Came down from the summit of Eryx
To launch his shafts on the earth,
Flying to infernal shores
He steeped his fatal weapons
In the boiling waters of the Styx.

Come down from the majestic peak
Indignant over timid ecstasies!
It is only a magnanimous lute
That sends forth divine music.
The heart of the sons of the lyre
Resembles the statue that sighs
On the sepulchre of Memnon;
To give it its voice and soul
The eye of day must strike it
With a pure ray of his flame.

And you, awakening again
The fires buried under ashes,
Want the last remnant of my soul
To disappear in broken strains!
Glory is the dream of a shade;
It has cut off too large a number
Of days it should have charmed.
You would have me sacrifice for it
This final breath of my life!
But this I would save for love.
