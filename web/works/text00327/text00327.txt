It Is a Beauteous Evening

It is a beauteous evening, calm and free:
 The holy time is quiet as a nun
 Breathless with adoration; the broad sun
 Is sinking down in its tranquillity;
 The gentleness of heaven is on the sea. 
Listen, the mighty being is awake
 And doth with his eternal motion make
 A sound like thunder – everlastingly! 
Dear child, dear girl, that walkest with me here,
 If thou appearst untouched by solemn thought
 Thy nature is not therefore less divine:
 Thou liest in Abraham’s bosom all the year,
 And worshipst at the temple’s inner shrine,
 God being with thee when we know it not.
