A La Promenade

The sky so pale, and the trees, such frail things,   
Seem as if smiling on our bright array
   That flits so light and gray upon the way
   With indolent airs and fluttering as of wings. 

The fountain wrinkles under a faint wind,
 And all the sifted sunlight falling through
 The lime-trees of the shadowy avenue
 Comes to us blue and shadowy-pale and thinned. 

Faultlessly fickle, and yet fond enough,
 With fond hearts not too tender to be free,
 We wander whispering deliciously,
 And every lover leads a lady-love,

Whose imperceptible and roguish hand   
Darts now and then a dainty tap, the lip   
Revenges on an extreme finger-tip,
 The tip of the left little finger, and,

The deed being so excessive and uncouth,
 A duly freezing look deals punishment,
 That in the instant of the aét is blent
   With a shy pity pouting in the mouth.
