Peter Bell

[Ll. 531-540, 571-580, 591-650]

Is it some party, in a parlour
 Crammed (just as they on earth were crammed),
 Some sipping punch, some sipping tea,
 But as you by their faces see,
 All silent and all damned? 

’Tis no such thing, I do assure you,
 Which Peter sees in the clear flood. 
It is no ugly apprehension
 Of eyes and ears, ’tis no invention –
 It is a thing of flesh and blood. 

And now poor Peter is convinced,
 While still he holds the ass’s head,
 That ’tis a fiend with visage wan,
 A live man-fiend, a living man,
 That’s lying in the river-bed. 

He looks, he looks, he looks again,
 He sees a motion, hears a groan;
 His eyes will burst, his heart will break,
 He gives a loud and dreadful shriek,
 And back he falls just like a stone. 

He lifts his head, he sees his staff,
 He touches – ’tis to him a treasure! 
To find that he is not in Hell,
 As you’ll suppose to Peter Bell
 Doth give a sweet and languid pleasure. 

And while upon his side he lies,
 His head upon his elbow raised,
 Almost you’d say as in a dream
 His eyes are settling on the stream
 Where he before had gazed. 

No dimple now disturbs the stream;
 In Peter’s brain there is no riot;
 His eye upon the stream he fixes,
 And with the sight no terror mixes,
 His heart is calm and quiet. 

Quoth he, ‘That is a dead man’s face
 Among the shadows of the trees! 
Those are no doubt a dead man’s knuckles,
 And there you see his brass shoe-buckles. 
And there his breeches’ knees.’ 

At last he rises from his side,
 And sits upright upon the ground,
 And o’er the stream he hangs his nose
 And points his staff as you’d suppose
 The river’s depth to sound. 

This sees the ass, while on the grass
 Close by the river’s brink he lies,
 And straight with a transition tragic,
 That seems just like the touch of magic,
 Up from the ground the ass doth rise. 

At this friend Peter round him looks,
 And sees the poor and patient creature
 Close to him, in his uncouth way
 Expressing all the joy he may
 In every limb and feature. 

His meagre bones all shake with joy,
 And close by Peter’s side he stands;
 While Peter o’er the river bends,
 The little ass his neck extends
 And fondly licks his hands. 

Such life is in the ass’s eyes,
 Such life is in his limbs and ears,
 That Peter Bell, if he had been
 The veriest coward ever seen,
 Must now have thrown aside his fears. 

With caution Peter eyes the stream
 (The sapling deep and deeper goes);
 ‘The body is no doubt’, quoth he,
 ‘The thing which it appears to be –
 It moves not, neither limbs, nor clothes.’ 

The ass looks on, and to his work
 Is Peter quietly resigned:
 He touches here, he touches there,
 And now among the dead man’s hair
 His sapling Peter has entwined. 

He pulls, and pulls, and pulls again,
 And he whom the poor ass had lost –
 The man who had been four days dead –
 Head-foremost from the river’s bed
 Uprises like a ghost!
