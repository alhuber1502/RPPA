The Forest

O primeval forest,
 Why art thou so pensive, -
 Why art thou so clouded
 By deep dark sorrow? 

Like the valiant knight
 Bova, under spell,
 Standing bareheaded
 On a battlefield, -

Standst thou drooping low
 And thou strugglest not
 With the swift storm-cloud
 That passeth thee by. 

Thy thick-leaved helm
 That would shine so green
 Is torn off by whirlwind,
 Dispelled into dust. 

At thy feet thy cloak
 Fallen, moulded lies ... 
Thou standst drooping low,
 Struggling not a bit. 

Hast thou lost indeed
 All thy glorious speech,
 All thy force so proud,
 All thy royal might? 

Was it thou who sang
 That wide warbling song
 On a silent night
 Like a nightingale? 

Was it thou who hadst
 Days of lavishing living, -
 When thou entertain’dst
 Both thy friends and foes? 

Was it thou who hadst
 In the late of night
 Formidable talks
 With the thunder-storm;

It would open wide
 Its dark feathery cloud
 And embrace you all
 With its icy wind. 

Thou wouldst say to it
 In a shrill voice: ‘Halt! 
‘Turn around, I pray,
 ‘Keep away from me!’ 

It would turn and lurch,
 It would blow great guns ... 
And thy breast would stir
 And begin to reel;

Thou wouldst shudder then,
 Thou wouldst rage and seethe:
 Whistling all amidst
 Voices, boom and hum ... 

And the storm would weep
 Like Puck or a witch, -
 And would carry its
 Clouds beyond the sea. 

Where is now thy power? 
Where is thy green strength? 
Thou hast all grown dark,
 Misty is thy sight ... 

Silent ... only when
 Elements are foul
 Thou wilt wail about
 Time that runs in vain. 

Thus, primeval forest,
 Bova, valiant knight,
 Hast thou spent thy life
 Ever struggling hard. 

It was not strong foes
 Who did master thee,
 It was autumn black
 That brought thee an end. 

While thou wast asleep,
 Unaware, unarmed,
 Treacherously foes
 Came in throng to thee. 

They cut off thine head
 From the shoulders strong –
 With a thin small straw,
 Not a heavy hill ...
