Well, I would have it so ...

Well, I would have it so. I should have known
   How many times I made her will my own. 
For once, at least, I should have let her he. 
And waited, till I made her come to me. 
No. I forget what fretful cries last night
   Drove me to bitter silence and to flight;
 This morning, O weak heart, I long   
To have her back, yet do her pride no wrong. 

I fly to her, take all her wrongs, but she
 Whom I would pardon will not pardon me. 
I it is who am false, unjust, and seek
 To show my horrid strength where she is weak. 
And floods and tempest come, and tears that flow
 Obediently, as she would have them go. 
And I, to have some peace, must own defeat,
 Kneel down, and take her pardon at her feet.
