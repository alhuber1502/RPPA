The Silesian Weavers

Their somber eyes no tears relieve,
They clench their teeth and sit and weave,
They say a threefold curse aloud
And weave it into Germany’s shroud —
We’re weaving, we’re weaving!

A curse on the God to whom we prayed
In winter’s cold and hunger’s need;
In vain we hoped, in vain we waited,
Mocked we were and fooled and cheated —
We’re weaving, we’re weaving!

A curse on the King, the King of the rich,
Whom our deep misery could not touch,
Who wrings from us our last few pounds,
And sends his men to shoot us like hounds —
We’re weaving, we’re weaving!

A curse on our false Fatherland
With shame and crime on every hand,
Where every flower fails to thrive
While rot and mold keep worms alive —
We’re weaving, we’re weaving!

The loom creaks and the shuttle plays,
We’re weaving all our nights and days —
We say our threefold curse aloud
And weave it in Old Germany’s shroud —
We’re weaving, we’re weaving!
