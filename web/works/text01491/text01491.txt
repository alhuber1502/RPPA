The Wall-Flower

O Wall-flower! or ever thy bright leaves fade,
 My limbs will be that of which all are made;
 Before ever thou losest thy crown of gold,
 My flesh will be mold. 

And yet open the casement! till I am dead
   Let my last look rest on thy golden head! 
My soul would kiss thee-before it flies
   To the open skies. 

Twice I am kissing thy fragrant mouth,
 And the first kiss wholly is thine, in truth;
 But the second remember, dear Love! to close
   On my fair white Rose. 

I shall not be living its Spring to see;
 But bring it my greeting when that shall be,
 And say that I wish’d that upon my grave   
It should bloom and wave. 

Yes! say that I wish’d that against my breast   
The Rose should lie that thy lips caress’d;
 And, Wall-flower! do thou into Death’s dark porch   
Be its bridal torch!
