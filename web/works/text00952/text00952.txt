I

Do you mourn the time when heaven walked on earth
And breathed among a race of godlike peers?
When Venus Astarte, to whom the sea gave birth,
While still a virgin, shook off her mother's tears
And fertilized the world while fingering her hair?
Do you mourn the time when wanton nymphs, all bare,
Undulated in the sun among the water weeds
And bursting with laughter teased the lazy fauns
Who lay upon the shore among the reeds?
When the springs would tremble at Narcissus 'kiss?
When from north to south through all the universe
Eternal Justice drove the hero Hercules,
Beneath his bloody cloak, trimmed with a lion's skin;
When the mocking Silvani, in the bark of trees,
Would hover with green branches in the wind,
And echo in their sighs the traveller's song;
When everything, even human anguish, was divine;
When the world worshipped what today it would kill;
When four thousand gods had not one atheist;
When everyone was happy but Prometheus,
Older brother of Satan, who like him would fall?
— And when everything was changed, man, heaven, and earth,
When the cradle of the world became its tomb,
When Rome's ruins felt the hurricane of the north
Overwhelm it beneath a shroud of gloom, —

Do you mourn the time when from a barbarous age
A golden age was born, more fertile and more fine;
When like Lazarus with rejuvenated brow
The old world broke apart its sealing stone?
Do you mourn the time when every old romance
Spread golden wings to its enchanted lands;
When all our monuments and all our beliefs
Wore the shining cloak of their virginity;
When everything was just reborn at Jesus 'hands;
When the palace of the prince and the house of the priest,
Bearing the same cross on their radiant brows,
Came down from the mountain while watching the skies;
Where Strasbourg and Cologne, Notre-Dame and Saint-Pierre,
Kneeling at a distance in their robes of stone,
On the universal organ of the people at prayer
Would sing the hosannas of the ages reborn;
The time when all things happened as the tales recite;
When open-armed the ivory crucifixes hung
On sacred altars, immaculate and milky white;
When Death would hope, — When Life was young?
