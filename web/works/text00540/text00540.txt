Rhyme I

I know of a gigantic and strange hymn which heralds a dawn in the dark night of the soul and these pages are about that hymn, cadences which dilate the soul in the shadows. I would write of it, dominating the rebellious and inadequate language of men, with words which were at the same time sighs and laughter, colours and musical notes. But it is in vain I struggle, for there is no cypher capable of enshrining it and, yet, o comely one!, if, holding your hands in mine, I could sing it in your ear while we are alone.
