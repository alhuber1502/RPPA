The Shepherd’s Calendar

[ "July" 90-131]

July

Loud is the Summer’s busy song,
 The smallest breeze can find a tongue,
 While insects of each tiny size
 Grow teasing with their melodies,
 Till noon burns with its blistering breath
 Around, and day dies still as death. 
The busy noise of man and brute
 Is on a sudden lost and mute;
 Even the brook that leaps along
 Seems weary of its bubbling song,
 And, so soft its waters creep,
 Tired silence sinks in sounder sleep. 
The cricket on its banks is dumb,
 The very flies forget to hum;
 And, save the wagon rocking round,
 The landscape sleeps without a sound. 
The breeze is stopped, the lazy bough
 Hath not a leaf that dances now;
 The tottergrass upon the hill,
 And spiders’ threads, are standing still;
 The feathers dropped from moorhen’s wing,
 Which to the water’s surface cling,
 Are steadfast, and as heavy seem
 As stones beneath them in the stream;
 Hawkweed and groundsel’s fanning downs
 Unruffled keep their seedy crowns;
 And in the oven-heated air,
 Not one light thing is floating there,
 Save that to the earnest eye
 The restless heat seems twittering by! 
Noon swoons beneath the heat it made,
 And flowers e’en wither in the shade,
 Until the sun slopes in the west,
 Like weary traveller, glad to rest,
 On pillowed clouds of many hues;
 Then Nature’s voice its joy renews,
 And chequered field and grassy plain
 Hum, with their summer songs again,
 A requiem to the day’s decline,
 Whose setting sunbeams coolly shine,
 As welcome to day’s feeble powers
 As falling dews to thirsty flowers.
