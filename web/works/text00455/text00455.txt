By the Fire Side

By the fireside seated, while the snowstorm blows wildly,
 I stare deep into the fire which shows me dear company;
 Through the flames of hazel boughs which burn so blue,
 My fantastic brain conjures up realms of wonders rare and new. 

Here a wondrous bird struggles with a dread ogre;
 Here are deer with starry foreheads on golden bridges;
 Here horses fly like thought and winged dragons over swift waters
 Hiding in majestic castles beauteous imperial daughters. 

Here brave and mighty falcons from the black world descend,
 To the white world, blending the princely and royal;
 Here on the milk-white lake fly fairies from high heavens ... 
And swift Puck1 in May flowers hidden, lies asleep nearby. 

Yet what so attracts me hither and so thoroughly enchants
 Is my Fairy Sweet Ileana! 2 ... In her tresses she plants flowers. 
I keep gazing till the dawn breaks and, rapt in pensive mood,
 Fondly I recall these memories which have so soon escaped.
