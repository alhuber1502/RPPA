In the Grass

Sweet repose, sweet reeling in grass,
Enveloped in fragrance of green,
Deep stream, deep deep drunken stream,
When the cloud dissolves in the blue,
When on my tired, swimming head
Sweetly laughter flutters down,
Dear voice murmurs, and trickles
Down like linden blooms onto a grave.

When in the breast then the dead,
Every corpse, stretches and stirs,
Quietly, quietly draws its breath,
Moves its tight-drawn lashes,
Dead love, dead joy, dead time,
All the treasures, immured in the dust
Touch one another, timidly sounding,
As tiny bells wave in the breeze.

Hours, more fleeting are you than the kiss
Of a beam on the sorrowing lake,
Than the song of the passing bird,
That drops like dew from the heights,
Than the glittering beetle’s flash,
As it hastes through the sun’s path,
Than the ardent clasp of a hand
As it lingers a final time.

Yet, O heaven, this alone
Ever for me: for the song
Of each bird free in the sky
Please, a soul, to fly with him,
But for each scanty beam
This my iridescent hem,
For each warm hand my clasp,
And for every joy my dream.
