Rhyme LXVI

Whence came I ...? Seek the most horrible and bitter of paths. The prints of bloody feet on the harsh rock; the spoil of a soul torn into shreds on sharp thorns will point the way to my cradle. Whence go I? Cross the most gloomy and sad of wasteland, valley of eternal snows and eternal melancholy mists, where stands a solitary stone without inscription, there will be my tomb.
