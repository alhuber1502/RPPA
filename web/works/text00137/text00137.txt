Through Springtime Walks

Through springtime walks, with flowers perfumed,
 I chased a wild capricious fair,
 Where hyacinths and jonquils bloomed,
 Chanting gay sonnets through the air;
 Hid amid a briary dell
 Or ’neath a hawthorn-tree,
 Her sweet enchantments led me on
 And still deluded me. 

While summer’s ’splendent glory smiles
 My ardent love in vain essayed,
 I strove to win her heart by wiles,
 But still a thousand pranks she played;
 Still o’er each sunburnt furzy hill,
 Wild, playful, gay, and free,
 She laughed and scorned; I chased her still,
 And still she bantered me. 

When autumn waves her golden ears
 And wafts o’er fruits her pregnant breath,
 The sprightly lark its pinions rears;
 I chased her o’er the daisied heath,
 And all around was glee –
 Still, wanton as the timid hart,
 She swiftly flew from me. 

Now winter lights its cheerful fire,
 While jests with frolic mirth resound
 And draws the wandering beauty nigher,
 ’Tis now too cold to rove around;
 The Christmas-game, the playful dance,
 Incline her heart to glee –
 Mutual we glow, and kindling love
 Draws every wish to me.
