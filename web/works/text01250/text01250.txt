Song

Enchantment of my past existence,
Why have you come to haunt me so?
Who prompts these memories’ persistence,
The voiceless dreams of long ago?
My heart has heard that whispered greeting,
Familiar eyes my soul revealed,
A vision for an instant fleeting
Of what the gulf of time concealed.

The past sweet-sacred visitation,
Why press me so insistently?
Can I say wake! to expectation?
Can I command what’s past to be?
Will there be fresh illumination
To beautify that faded view?
Can I clothe in imagination
The naked life that once I knew?

For that far country why keep yearning,
Where days were such as are rto more?
To lands once lost there’s no returning,
Nor sight of years gone long before.
One dweller in that land reposes,
Mute witness of sweet yesterday;
Along with him those days of roses
In common grave are laid away.
