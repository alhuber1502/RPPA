The Thorn

‘There is a thorn, it looks so old
 In truth you’d find it hard to say
 How it could ever have been young,
 It looks so old and grey. 
Not higher than a two years’ child
 It stands erect, this agéd thorn. 
No leaves it has, no thorny points;
 It is a mass of knotted joints,
 A wretched thing forlorn. 
It stands erect, and like a stone
 With lichens it is overgrown. 
Like rock or stone, it is o’ergrown
 With lichens to the very top,
 And hung with heavy tufts of moss,
 A melancholy crop. 
Up from the earth these mosses creep,
 And this poor thorn they clasp it round
 So close you’d say that they were bent
 With plain and manifest intent
 To drag it to the ground,
 And all had joined in one endeavour
 To bury this poor thorn for ever. 

High on a mountain’s highest ridge
 (Where oft the stormy winter gale
 Cuts like a scythe, while through the clouds
 It sweeps from vale to vale),
 Not five yards from the mountain-path
 This thorn you on your left espy;
 And to the left, three yards beyond,
 You see a little muddy pond
 Of water, never dry. 
I’ve measured it from side to side:
 ’Tis three feet long and two feet wide. 

And close beside this ag
                ed
               thorn
 There is a fresh and lovely sight
 A beauteous heap, a hill of moss,
 Just half a foot in height. 
All lovely colours there you see,
 All colours that were ever seen,
 And mossy network too is there,
 As if by hand of lady fair
 The work had woven been –
 And cups, the darlings of the eye,
 So deep is their vermilion dye. 

Ah me, what lovely tints are there
 Of olive-green and scarlet bright,
 In spikes, in branches, and in stars,
 Green, red, and pearly white! 
This heap of earth o’ergrown with moss,
 Which close beside the thorn you see
 So fresh in all its beauteous dyes,
 Is like an infant’s grave in size –
 As like as like can be –
 But never, never, anywhere
 An infant’s grave was half so fair! 

Now would you see this ag
                ed
               thorn,
 This pond and beauteous hill of moss,
 You must take care and choose your time
 The mountain when to cross. 
For oft there sits, between the heap
 That’s like an infant’s grave in size
 And that same pond of which I spoke,
 A woman in a scarlet cloak,
 And to herself she cries,
 Oh misery! Oh misery! 
Oh woe is me, oh misery!” 

At all times of the day and night
 This wretched woman thither goes,
 And she is known to every star,
 And every wind that blows. 
And there beside the thorn she sits
 When the blue daylight’s in the skies,
 And when the whirlwind’s on the hill,
 Or frosty air is keen and still,
 And to herself she cries,
 “Oh misery! Oh misery! 
Oh woe is me, oh misery!”’ 

‘Now wherefore thus, by day and night,
 In rain, in tempest, and in snow,
 Thus to the dreary mountain-top
 Does this poor woman go? 
And why sits she beside the thorn
 When the blue daylight’s in the sky,
 Or when the whirlwind’s on the hill,
 Or frosty air is keen and still,
 And wherefore does she cry –
 Oh wherefore, wherefore, tell me why,
 Does she repeat that doleful cry?’ 

‘I cannot tell, I wish I could,
 For the true reason no one knows;
 But if you’d gladly view the spot,
 The spot to which she goes –
 The heap that’s like an infant’s grave,
 The pond and thorn, so old and grey –
 Pass by her door (’tis seldom shut)
 And if you see her in her hut,
 Then to the spot away! 
I never heard of such as dare
 Approach the spot when she is there!’ 

But wherefore to the mountain-top
 Can this unhappy woman go,
 Whatever star is in the skies,
 Whatever wind may blow?’ 
‘Nay, rack your brain, ’tis all in vain! 
I’ll tell you everything I know –
 But to the thorn, and to the pond
 Which is a little step beyond,
 I wish that you would go:
 Perhaps when you are at the place
 You something of her tale may trace. 

I’ll give you the best help I can:
 Before you up the mountain go,
 Up to the dreary mountain-top,
 I’ll tell you all I know. 
’Tis now some two-and-twenty years
 Since she (her name is Martha Ray)
 Gave with a maiden’s true good will
 Her company to Stephen Hill,
 And she was blithe and gay –
 And she was happy, happy still
 Whene’er she thought of Stephen Hill. 

And they had fixed the wedding-day –
 The morning that must wed them both –
 But Stephen to another maid
 Had sworn another oath,
 And with this other maid to church
 Unthinking Stephen went. 
Poor Martha, on that woeful day
 A cruel, cruel fire, they say,
 Into her bones was sent –
 It dried her body like a cinder,
 And almost turned her brain to tinder! 
They say, full six months after this,
 While yet the summer-leaves were green,
 She to the mountain-top would go,
 And there was often seen. 
’Tis said a child was in her womb,
 As now to any eye was plain:
 She was with child and she was mad –
 Yet often she was sober sad
 From her exceeding pain. 
Oh me, ten thousand times I’d rather
 That he had died, that cruel father! 

Sad case for such a brain to hold
 Communion with a stirring child –
 Sad case, as you may think, for one
 Who had a brain so wild! 
Last Christmas when we talked of this,
 Old Farmer Simpson did maintain
 That in her womb the infant wrought
 About its mother’s heart, and brought
 Her senses back again;
 And when at last her time drew near,
 Her looks were calm, her senses clear. 

No more I know, I wish I did,
 And I would tell it all to you –
 For what became of this poor child
 There’s none that ever knew;
 And if a child was born or no,
 There’s no one that could ever tell;
 And if ’twas born alive or dead,
 There’s no one knows, as I have said –
 But some remember well
 That Martha Ray about this time
 Would up the mountain often climb. 

And all that winter, when at night
 The wind blew from the mountain-peak,
 ’Twas worth your while, though in the dark,
 The churchyard-path to seek;
 For many a time and oft were heard
 Cries coming from the mountain-head. 
Some plainly living voices were,
 And others (I’ve heard many swear)
 Were voices of the dead –
 I cannot think, whate’er they say,
 They had to do with Martha Ray. 

But that she goes to this old thorn,
 The thorn which I’ve described to you,
 And there sits in a scarlet cloak,
 I will be sworn is true. 
For one day with my telescope,
 To view the ocean wide and bright
 (When to this country first I came,
 Ere I had heard of Martha’s name),
 I climbed the mountain’s height;
 A storm came on, and I could see
 No object higher than my knee. 

’Twas mist and rain, and storm and rain! 
No screen, no fence, could I discover –
 And then the wind, in faith it was
 A wind full ten times over! 
I looked around, I thought I saw
 A jutting crag, and off I ran
 Head-foremost through the driving rain
 The shelter of the crag to gain,
 And, as I am a man,
 Instead of jutting crag I found
 A woman seated on the ground. 

I did not speak – I saw her face –
 Her face it was enough for me! 
I turned about and heard her cry,
 “Oh misery! Oh misery!” 
And there she sits, until the moon
 Through half the clear blue sky will go;
 And when the little breezes make
 The waters of the pond to shake
 (As all the country know),
 She shudders, and you hear her cry,
 “Oh misery! Oh misery!”’ 

But what’s the thorn, and what’s the pond,
 And what’s the hill of moss to her? 
And what’s the creeping breeze that comes
 The little pond to stir?’ 
‘I cannot tell, but some will say
 She hanged her baby on the tree;
 Some say she drowned it in the pond,
 Which is a little step beyond;
 But all and each agree
 The little babe was buried there,
 Beneath that hill of moss so fair. 

I’ve heard the scarlet moss is red
 With drops of that poor infant’s blood –
 But kill a new-born infant thus,
 I do not think she could! 
Some say, if to the pond you go
 And fix on it a steady view,
 The shadow of a babe you trace,
 A baby and a baby’s face,
 And that it looks at you –
 Whene’er you look on it, ’tis plain
 The baby looks at you again. 

And some had sworn an oath that she
 Should be to public justice brought;
 And for the little infant’s bones
 With spades they would have sought. 
But then the beauteous hill of moss
 Before their eyes began to stir,
 And for full fifty yards around
 The grass it shook upon the ground –
 But all do still aver
 The little babe is buried there,
 Beneath that hill of moss so fair. 

I cannot tell how this may be,
 But plain it is the thorn is bound
 With heavy tufts of moss that strive
 To drag it to the ground. 
And this I know, full many a time
 When she was on the mountain high,
 By day, and in the silent night
 When all the stars shone clear and bright,
 That I have heard her cry,
 “Oh misery! Oh misery! 
Oh woe is me, oh misery!”’
