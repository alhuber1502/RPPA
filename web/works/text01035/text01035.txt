The Broken Ring

Within a watered valley
A mill turns night and day;
And there my love was dwelling
Before she went away.

A little ring she gave me,
A pledge to bind her heart;
But since her troth she’s broken,
My ring has come apart.

I fain would go as minstrel
And wander far away,
And earn my bread by singing
My songs from day to day.

I fain would mount a charger
And glory seek in fight,
By silent camp-fires lying,
When falls the dark of night.

For when I hear the mill-wheel,
I know not what I will. — -
I fain would die, then surely
It would at last be still!
