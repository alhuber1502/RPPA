Death

I will not call Death darkness’ daughter
nor, slave to some received idea,
equip her with the tools of slaughter
as graveyard skeletons appear.

O daughter of the realms supernal!
O radiant beauty’s rarest shade!
Your hands bear olive, peace eternal,
no scything, all-destroying blade.

When out the flow’ring world came leaping
from savage forces’ equal strife,
Almighty God into your keeping
consigned its working and its life.

And you fly up above creation
dispensing concord’s influence,
and with your cooling inspiration
you calm mere being’s turbulence.

You curb betimes the mad commotion
of hurricanes’ o’erpowering roar
as you turn back the raging ocean
when oft it dashes to the shore.

And you set bounds to vegetation
so that no giant woods may rise
to threaten earth’s obliteration,
or grass grow upwards to the skies.

And, as for man, by all that’s holy!,
At your approach his cheeks turn white;
high-colored wrath at once ebbs wholly —
lascivious flushes vanish quite.

Your impartial law redresses
the wrongs of man’s unequal fate:
that selfsame hand of yours caresses
both serving wretch and potentate.

This mixed oppression and confusion,
the age we live in and its pains —
all problems find their resolution
in you, dissolver of all chains.
