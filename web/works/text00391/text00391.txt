The Poet’s Lot

The poet’s lovely faith creates
 The beauty he believes;
 The light which on his footsteps waits,
 He from himself receives. 

His lot may be a weary lot,
 His thrall a heavy thrall,
 And cares and griefs the crowd know not,
 His heart may know them all. 

But still he hath a mighty dower,
 The loveliness that throws
 Over the common thought and hour
 The beauty of the rose.
