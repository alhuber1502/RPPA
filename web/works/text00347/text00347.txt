Ballad

Mary, fate lent me a moment of pleasure
 Just to insure me in ages of pain –
 Just bid me meet thee and wish for the treasure
 To frown back and tell me I wisht it in vain! 
Just like spring sunshine I met with thee, Mary,
 That shines for a moment and cloudeth again;
 But, alas in our love there is one thing contrary
 Fate’s clouds of that moment cleared never again. 

Mary, fond feelings will never forsake me –
 Never again though I’m happy with thee –
 Hope paints the cure that enraptured could make me
 Tho’ fate to torment, vows it never shall be! 
Mary, hope whispers some chance in our favour,
 That still I may gaze on thy beauties once more,
 But Fate’s bonds are on me, that cruel enslaver,
 And love is not lawful to meet as before. 

Mary how sweet when love basked in thy feature,
 Mary how saddened the sighs rose and fell;
 Surely those sighs was the instinct of Nature
 Of future forebodings Fate cared no to tell. 
Mary thy smiles still endear our departure,
 Though they do haunt me in gloomy deform;
 Like waining sunbeams the clouds follow after
 That just give a glance ere they’re lost in the storm.
