Milton

[‘I Come In Self-Annihilation’, plate 4, ll. 2-28]

I come in self-annihilation and the grandeur of inspiration
 To cast off rational demonstration by faith in the Saviour,
 To cast off the rotten rags of memory by inspiration,
 To cast off Bacon, Locke and Newton from Albion’s covering,
 To take off his filthy garments, and clothe him with imagination,
 To cast aside from poetry all that is not inspiration,
 That it no longer shall dare to mock with the aspersion of madness
 Cast on the inspired by the tame high finisher of paltry blots
 Indefinite, or paltry rhymes, or paltry harmonies,
 Who creeps into state government like a caterpillar to destroy –
 To cast off the idiot questioner, who is always questioning,
 But never capable of answering; who sits with a sly grin
 Silent plotting when to question, like a thief in a cave;
 Who publishes doubt, and calls it knowledge; whose science is despair,
 Whose pretence to knowledge is envy, whose whole science is
 To destroy the wisdom of ages to gratify ravenous envy
 That rages round him like a wolf day and night without rest. 
He smiles with condescension, he talks of benevolence and virtue
 And those who act with benevolence and virtue they murder time on time! 
These are the destroyers of Jerusalem, these are the murderers
 Of Jesus, who deny the faith and mock at eternal life;
 Who pretend to poetry that they may destroy imagination
 By imitation of nature’s images drawn from remembrance! 
These are the sexual garments, the abomination of desolation
 Hiding the human lineaments as with an ark and curtains,
 Which Jesus rent – and now shall wholly purge away with fire,
 Till generation is swallowed up in regeneration.
