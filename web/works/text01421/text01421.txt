The Hanging of Vasil Levski

O mother mine, dear motherland,
 Why do you weep so piteously? 
And raven – you accursed bird –
 Your grim croak sounds above whose grave? 
O, I know, I know, you weep, my mother,
 Because you are a wretched slave,
 Because your sacred voice, my mother,
 Is a voice alone in a desert waste. 
Weep on. There – near the town of Sofia –
 I saw a wretched gallows jut,
 And one of your sons, Bulgaria,
 Was hanging with a chilling force. 
The raven croaks with evil omen,
 Dogs and wolves howl in the fields,
 The old men pray to God with fervour,
 The children scream, the women wail. 
The winter sings its baleful song,
 Squalls chase thistles on the plain,
 And cold and frost and hopeless tears
 Overwhelm your heart with pain.
