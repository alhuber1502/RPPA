The Prelude

[Book IX. ‘Residence in France’, ll. 294 – 299, 511 – 534 (‘A Patriot’: Blois, early Summer 1792)]

Among that band of officers was one,
 Already hinted at, of other mould –
 A patriot, thence rejected by the rest,
 And with an oriental loathing spurned
 As of a different caste. A meeker man
 Than this lived never, or a more benign. 
And when we chanced
 One day to meet a hunger-bitten girl
 Who crept along fitting her languid self
 Unto a heifer’s motion – by a cord
 Tied to her arm, and picking thus from the lane
 Its sustenance, while the girl with her two hands
 Was busy knitting in a heartless mood
 Of solitude – and at the sight my friend
 In agitation said, ‘’Tis against that
 Which we are fighting!’ I with him believed
 Devoutly that a spirit was abroad
 Which could not be withstood; that poverty,
 At least like this, would in a little time
 Be found no more; that we should see the Earth
 Unthwarted in her wish to recompense
 The industrious and the lowly child of toil,
 All institutes for ever blotted out
 That legalized exclusion, empty pomp
 Abolished, sensual state and cruel power
 Whether by edict of the one or few),
 And finally, as sum and crown of all,
 Should see the people having a strong hand
 In making their own laws – whence better days
 To all mankind!
