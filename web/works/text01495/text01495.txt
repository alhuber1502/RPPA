Fatherland Song  

Yes, we love this land together,
 Where the wild sea foams,
 Furrowed, beat by wind and weather,
 With the thousand homes. 
Yes, we love her; with her blending   
Father, mother, birth,
 And that saga-twilight sending
   Dreams upon our earth. 

This the land that Harold savèd   
With his warriors young;
 All for this land Haakon bravèd,
 WhiKt that Oevin sung. 
Olaf with his blood hath printed
   Cross upon her loam;
 From her highlands Swerre stinted   
Not to talk to Rome. 

Peasants ground their axes’ edges
   At the call to go;
 Tordenskjold along the ledges   
Homeward lit the foe. 
Women too stood up that day,
 Smote as they were men;
 Others could but weep and pray,
 Nor was that in vain. 

Evil times could not undo us,
 We outstood the same;
 But when straits were sorest, to us   
Blue-eyed Freedom came. 
That gave strength of olden story
   Hunger, war, to face;
 That gave even death its glory,
 Gave new ties of race. 

Foe its weapon cast, and slew them —
 Up our visors then! 
We in wonder hastened to them,
 For they were our kin. 
Southward, sped by shame, we thither
   Fared into their land;
 Now we stand three sons together
   And shall ever stand. 

Norsemen, ye in hut and hall,
 Thank the Lord of Hosts! 
Guard he will the land and all,
 Howso dark the coasts. 
All for which the fathers perished,
 And the mothers wept,
 Flath the Lord in stillness cherished —
 So we won and kept. 

Yes, we love this land together,
 Where the wild sea foams,
 Furrowed, beat by wind and weather. 
With the thousand homes. 
As our fathers’ battles freed us   
Out of old distress,
 We’ll to war, if once she need us,
 For her peace no less.
