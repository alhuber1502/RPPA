Grandfather and grandson

The grandfather took his grandson,
 Sat him on his lap,
 And sang to him to the accompaniment of the gusle
 Of what had once been. 

He sang to him of Serbian glory
 And of Serbian heroes,
 He sang to him of fierce battles,
 Of many a hardship. 

The grandfather’s eye glowed,
 So he shed a tear,
 And he told his grandson
 To kiss the gusle. 

The child kissed the gusle
 And then asked with interest,
 ‘Tell me, grandpa; Why did I
 kiss that gusle?’ 

‘You do not understand, you little Serb –
 Us old folk, we know;
 When you’ve grown up, when you’ve thought it out,
 You’ll see for yourself!’
