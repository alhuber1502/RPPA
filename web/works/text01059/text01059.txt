A star is falling slowly ...

A star is falling slowly
From the twinkling sky above!
I see its shining pathway â€”
It is the star of love.

From apple trees are falling
Buds and leaves away.
The merry breezes gather
And whirl them round in play.

On the lake a swan is singing,
Floating on its grave,
And singing soft and softer
It sinks beneath the wave.

It is so dark and silent!
The trees are blighted and bare,
The star is dust and ashes,
The swan song fades on the air.
