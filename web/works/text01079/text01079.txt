The Oak Grove

I trod that day the sacred shadows
Of an oak grove; along the way
I heard a brook by wild flowers flowing
With still voice hushed, as children pray.

A blissful awe had seized my spirit.
The forest accents, rustling, low,
Seemed as by stealth to, hint a « secret
It was not yet my right to know,

Seemed on the brink of revelation
Of what God’s love has thought and willed —
Then suddenly the forest trembled
As at God’s nearness — and w$s stilled.
