A Gleam of Light

On some dark evening have you heard
The Aeolian harp’s soft songs,
When the night suddenly disturbs
The slumber of its strings?

Sounds that stir up our inmost being,
Then quickly die again ...
As if we heard in them the last
Dull echoes of our pain.

The strings cry out in agony
With every passing zephyr ...
An angel’s lyre is grieving in
The dust, longing for heaven.

Oh how our souls then fly from the earth
To immortality!
As to some dear departed ghost
We cling to former years.

How we believe, with a living faith,
How happy the heart, how light!
As if heaven flowed through every vein,
Ethereal, all bright!

Alas, this cannot be our lot;
Of heaven we shall soon tire —
It is not given to feeble dust
To breathe the celestial fire.

A moment’s effort and we break through
The dream that charms our eyes,
Rise up, and scan the firmament
With a dim and anxious gaze, —

Then, dazzled by a single beam,
With heavy head, at last
We fall again, to find not peace,
But the tedious world of dream.
