Lützow’s Wild Chase

What is it that beams in the bright sunshine,
 And echoes yet nearer and nearer
 And see, it spreads out in a long dark line,
 And hark how yon horns in the distance combine
 To impress with affright the hearer. 
And ask ye what means the daring chase;
 This is this is Lützow’s wild and desperate chase! 

See, they leave the dark wood in silence all,
 And from hill to hill are seen flying;
 In ambush they ’ll lie ’till the deep nightfall,
 Thenye’ll hear the hurrah! and the rifle ball! 
And the French will be falling and dying! 
And ask ye what means their daring race? 
This is – Lützow’s wild and desperate chase

Where the vine-boughs twine, the Rhine waves roar,
 And the foe thinks its waters shall hide him;
 But see, they, fearless approach the shore;
 And they leap in the stream, and swim proudly o’er,
 And stand on the bank beside him! 
And ask ye what means the daring race? 
This is – Lützow’s wild and desperate chase! 

Why roars in the valley the raging fight,
 Where swords clash red and gory? 
O fierce is the strife of that deadly fight,
 For the spark of young Freedom is newly alight,
 And it breaks into flames of glory! 
And ask ye what means the daring race? 
This is – Lützow’s wild and desperate chase! 

See yon warrior who lies on a gory spot,
 From life compell’d to sever;
 Yet he never is heard to lament his lot,
 And his soul at its parting shall tremble not,
 Since his country is saved for ever! 
And if ye will ask at the end of his race,
 Still ’tis – Lützow’s wild and desperate chase! 

The wild chase, and the German chase
 Against tyranny and oppression! 
Therefore weep not, lov’d friends, at this last embrace
 For Freedom has dawn’d on our loved birth-place,
 And our deaths shall ensure its possession! 
And ’t will ever be said from race to race,
 This was – Lützow’s wild and desperate chase!
