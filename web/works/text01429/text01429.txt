Rise, O Serbia

Rise, O Serbia! Rise, O empress! 
And let your children see your face. 
Turn their hearts and eyes unto you,
 And let them hear your sweet voice. 
Rise, O Serbia! 
You fell asleep long ago,
 You lay in darkness. 
Wake up now
 And stir up the Serbs! 

You raise your imperial head up,
 Let the earth and the sea know you again. 
Show Europe your beautiful face,
 Bright and cheerful like the appearance of Venus. 
Rise, O Serbia! 
You fell asleep long ago,
 You lay in darkness. 
Wake up now
 And stir up the Serbs! 

Remember, O our mother, your first glory,
 Shame the heads of your enemies! 
Expel the wild janissary from Vračar
 Who now does not obey his very emperor! 
Rise, O Serbia! 
You fell asleep long ago,
 You lay in darkness. 
Wake up now
 And stir up the Serbs! 

You are now aided by heaven’s will
 And are now facing a better destiny. 
All your neighbors wish you well
 And remote nations rejoice at your well-being. 
Rise, O Serbia! 
You fell asleep long ago,
 You lay in darkness. 
Wake up now
 And stir up the Serbs! 

Rise, O Serbia! Rise, O our dear mother! 
And become once more what you used to be. 
The sincere Serbian children,
 Who are fighting for you now call for you. 
Rise, O Serbia! 
You fell asleep long ago,
 You lay in darkness. 
Wake up now
 And stir up the Serbs! 

Bosnia, your sister, looks at you
 And wishes you no harm. 
He who hates you, fears not God. 
From whom many an aid descends unto you. 
Rise, O Serbia! 
You fell asleep long ago,
 You lay in darkness. 
Wake up now
 And stir up the Serbs! 

Herzegovina and Montenegro,
 Faraway countries and islands in the sea,
 All of them wish you heavenly assistance,
 All good souls rejoice at you,
 And say in unison:
 Rise, O Serbia! 
You fell asleep long ago,
 You lay in darkness. 
Wake up now
 And stir up the Serbs!
