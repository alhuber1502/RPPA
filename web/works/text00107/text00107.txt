The Banks o’ Doon

Ye flowery banks o’ bonnie Doon
 How can ye blume sae fair,
 How can ye chant, ye little birds,
 And I sae fu’ o’care? 

Thou’ll break my heart, thou bonnie bird
 That sings upon the bough,
 Thou minds me o’ the happy days
 When my fause luve was true. 

Thou’ll break my heart, thou bonnie bird
 That sings beside thy mate,
 For sae I sat, and sae I sang,
 And wist na o’ my fate. 

Aft hae I roved by bonnie Doon
 To see the woodbine twine,
 And ilka bird sang o’ its love,
 And sae did I o’ mine. 

Wi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose
 Frae aff its thorny tree,
 And my fause luver staw the rose,
 But left the thorn wi’ me! 

Wi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose
 Upon a morn in June,
 And sae I flourished on the morn,
 And sae was pu’d or noon!
