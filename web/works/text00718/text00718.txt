Autumn Leaves

The leaves though thick are falling; one by one
Decayed they drop from off their parent tree;
Their work with autumn’s latest day is done,
Thou see’st them borne upon its breezes free;
They lie strown here and there, their many dyes
That yesterday so caught thy passing eye;
Soiled by the rain each leaf neglected lies,
Upon the path where now thou hurriest by;
Yet think thee not their beauteous tints less fair,
Than when they hung so gaily o’er thy head;
But rather find thee eyes, and look thee there
Where now thy feet so heedless o’er them tread;
And thou shalt see where wasting now they lie,
The unseen hues of immortality.
