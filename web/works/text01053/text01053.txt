On the Tower

I stand on the tower’s high balcony,
The shrieking starling streaks by.
And like a maenad I let the storm
Rumple and tear at my hair.
Oh my wild comrade and crazy boy,
I long to embrace you and match
My strength against yours, two steps from the edge
And wrestle with you to the death.

And as I look down at the beach, the waves
Are like hunting dogs at play,
Foaming and bellowing they rave,
And up leaps the glistening spray.
How gladly I’d jump to be among
That raging pack of hounds
And follow through the coral woods
The walrus with merry sound.

And further I see a pennant blow
Bold as a battle banner.
And the prow of the ship goes up and down,
As I watch from my airy rampart.
Oh, I want to stand in that fighting ship
And grasp the steering wheel
And over the spitting, hissing deep
Glide as the seagull will.

If I were a hunter, out in the wild,
If I were a bit of a soldier,
If I were at least and simply a man,
Then Heaven would counsel and hold me.
But now I must sit like a good little girl,
Sweet, delicate and fair.
And I have to hide to let the wind
Blow freely through my hair.
