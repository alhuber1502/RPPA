Sonnet I

In the shimmering windows of the dark churches
The flames of the western sun fade and die away;
Precious relics of an age that is no longer,
Their vaults trace a black shape against the azure sky;

And then the moon appears, its slanting rays
Half silvering the spire far above the ground
And the last branches of the melancholy pines,
Their shadow swaying and spreading all around.

Then the resounding of the ringing church-bell
Seems the distant voice of an aerial world
That home on the wind to this world faintly falls;

And the poet, sitting near the waves, on the shore,
Hears the fleeting tones as though they float in dreams,
And, gazing at the sky in sadness, he recalls.
