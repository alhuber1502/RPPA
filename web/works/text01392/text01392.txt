A Poem for the Goddess Her City & the Marriage of Her Son & Daughter

she builds her city
 the white goddess
 builds it
 not on the sky or earth
 but on a cloud branch
 builds
 three gates to enter it
 one gate she builds
 in gold
 the second pearls
 the third in scarlet
 where the gate is dry gold
 there the goddess’ son
 is wedded
 where the gate
 is pearl
 the goddess’ daughter
 is the bride
 & where the gate is scarlet
 solitary
 sits the goddess
 solitary glances
 everywhere
 she sees
 the lightning
 playing with the thunder
 the precious sister
 with two brothers
 & the bride
 plays with
 the bridegroom’s
 brothers
 there the goddess sees
 the lightning
 win it all
 the precious sister
 over her two brothers
 & the bride
 over her bridegroom’s brothers
 & the goddess was enchanted by it
