The Sparrow’s Nest

Look, five blue eggs are gleaming there! 
Few visions have I seen more fair,
 Nor many prospects of delight
 More pleasing than that simple sight. 
I started, seeming to espy
 The home and sheltered bed,
 The sparrow’s dwelling, which hard by
 My father’s house in wet or dry,
 My sister Emmeline and I
 Together visited. 
She looked at it as if she feared it –
 Still wishing, dreading to be near it –
 Such heart was in her, being then
 A little prattler among men. 
The blessing of my later years
 Was with me when a boy:
 She gave me eyes, she gave me ears,
 And humble cares, and delicate fears,
 A heart, the fountain of sweet tears,
 And love, and thought, and joy.
