Hymns to the Night

[5]

The dreadful thing approached the cheerful table
And buried every heart in frantic fears.
The gods themselves could utter nothing helpful,
To soothe the fearful breasts with wisdom’s balm.
Mysterious the path this brute had taken,
Whose fury no appeal or gift could calm;
It was Death who broke apart this joyous revel
With anxious dread and bitter pain and tears.

Forever now from all things separated
That here can bring the heart sweet happiness,
Cut off from loved ones here below whose longings
Are stirred by vain desire and misery,
Dull dreams to the dead one seemed apportioned:
He had to suffer pointless agony.
Shattered was the wave of endless pleasure
On the sharp rock of endless bitterness.

With daring verve and lofty warmth of feeling
Men made more beautiful that loathsome sight;
The light a gentle youth would now extinguish —
The end was gentle, like a harpstring’s sound.
Remembrance melts in the cool flood of shadows:
So sang the song to those in sadness bound.
Yet endless night would still remain unfathomed,
The solemn emblem of a distant might.

You are the youth who for a long time
Has stood on our graves with thoughts deep in mind;
A sign of comfort in the darkness —
The joyful start of higher humankind.
What once had cast us deep in sadness,
Now draws us out with yearning in our soul.
In death, eternal life is now made known,
You are death, and the first to make us whole.

Raised up is the stone —
And risen humankind —
With you we all abide
And no more feel the chain.
The harshest griefs now flee
Before your golden grail,
When earth and life subside
At die last evening meal.

Death calls us to the wedding —
The lamps are blazing forth —
The virgins are all present —
Of oil there is no dearth —
Oh let the distance echo
With the coming of your train.
And let the stars now call us
With tongue and tone humane.

To you are lifted, Mary,
A thousand hearts anew,
For in this life of shadows
They only long for you.
They seek rejuvenation
With hopeful joy and trust.
Oh press them, holy being,
To your faithful breast.

So many once were burning,
Consumed in bitter grief,
But from this world escaping
In you they found relief;
They came to us with comfort
For torment and despair —
As we come now to join them
To be eternal there.

No one with loving faith now
Weeps anguished at a grave.
No one will lose the sweetness
Of the gift that love once gave.
Now Night sends inspiration
To soothe the one who wept —
By heaven's faithful children
His heart is closely kept.

Our life toward life eternal
Will now serenely flow;
Our minds will be transfigured
By a heightened inner glow.
In the wine of life all golden
The starworld now dissolves,
With rapture we will drink it
And be bright stars ourselves.

Now love is freely given,
No parting can there be.
The whole of life now surges
Like an endless sea.
Only one eternal poem —
One Night of joyful'grace —
And the sun of all of us
Is found within God’s face.
