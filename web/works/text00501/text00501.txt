[National Anthem]

This our land – indeed we love it
 With its homes, our land,
 Rising through the pines above it
 On the wave-lashed strand. 
Ever with that thought is blending
 Those who gave us birth,
 And the saga-night descending
 Softly on our earth. 

Harald’s warriors fought to gain it,
 Loud their weapons rang. 
Haakon struggled to maintain it,
 There too Öivind sang. 
Olaf set the cross upon it
 In his blood outpoured,
 After his bold faith had won it
 To receive Our Lord. 

When the peasant’s axe was flashing,
 Foes turned back in dread,
 Tordenskjold sent bolts a-crashing
 Till the invader fled. 
Women even took their places
 In the ranks of war;
 Others prayed, with weeping faces,
 When the guns would roar. 

Few we were and sorely tested,
 But we never failed. 
Oft the battle-tide we breasted,
 And our might prevailed. 
Better turn our soil to embers
 Than one inch to yield. 
Grimly Fredrikshall remembers
 How we kept the field. 

Hard the night of our probation,
 Yet it led to morn;
 Then was in our desperation
 Blue-eyed Freedom born. 
So our sires of ancient story
 Learned to fight and fast. 
Death itself was crowned with glory –
 Then came peace at last. 

Weapon sheathed and helm unfastened,
 Stood our former foe. 
Wondering much, to him we hastened;
 ’Twas our brother, lo! 
We were smit alike with shame now,
 Gone our cruel pride;
 We three brothers are the same now
 And shall so abide. 

Son of Norway, give thou ever
 Thanks to God on high! 
He will guard, forsaking never,
 When the storm is nigh. 
For when women all were weeping,
 Men were in the fight,
 Still our land was in His keeping,
 And we won our right. 

This our land, indeed we love it
 With its homes, our land,
 Rising through the pines above it
 On the wave-lashed strand. 
As our sires in bygone ages
 Went to victory;
 When once more the conflict rages,
 So again will we.
