Old Man Travelling

The little hedgerow-birds
 That peck along the road, regard him not;
 He travels on, and in his face, his step,
 His gait, is one expression. Every limb,
 His look and bending figure, all bespeak
 A man who does not move with pain, but moves
 With thought. He is insensibly subdued
 To settled quiet, he is one by whom
 All effort seems forgotten â€“ one to whom
 Long patience hath such mild composure given
 That patience now doth seem a thing of which
 He hath no need. He is by Nature led
 To peace so perfect that the young behold
 With envy what the old man hardly feels.
