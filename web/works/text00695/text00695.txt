Freedom and Truth

To a friend

The shrine is vowed to freedom, but, my friend,
Freedom is but a means to gain an end.
Freedom should build a temple, but the shrine
Be consecrate to thought still more divine.
The human bliss which angel hopes foresaw
Is liberty to comprehend the law.
Give, then, thy book a larger scope and frame,
Comprising means and end in Truthâ€™s great name.
