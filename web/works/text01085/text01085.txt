On a Winter Morning, Before Sunrise

O feathery light time of the dark dawn,
What new world have you brought to life in me?
What can this mean, so suddenly to be
Aglow in you with joy to have been born?

My soul is like a crystal in this moment,
That no false ray of light as yet has stricken;
My spirit seems to flow, and to be pent,
Then to the touch of wondrous powers quicken
Thronging before my senses, summoned there
By magic out of the clear blue belt of air.

With open eyes I seem to lose all grip on earth;
I shut them lest the dream escape and go:
Now do I gaze on shining fairy realms below?
Who brings these motley thoughts and images to birth,
Crowding the portal of my heart and so
Luminous within me as they swim around
Like little goldfish in a garden pond?

The noise of shepherd pipings now I hear,
As by the crib that wondrous night they played;
Now young folk singing canticles of cheer;
Who brought with vineleaves crowned these people nepr,
In my sad room their peaceful cavalcade?

And what a sense of power thrills my mood
Now briskly as my thought moves far away,
And drenched with this first essence of the day
I feel the courage to be doing good.
My soul flies on, as far as heaven is,
My angel shouts for joy! And yet, how can this be,
What makes my gaze now moisten with a sadness?
Is it some lost joy that is softening me?
Or in my heart a burgeoning of bliss?
— On, on, my spirit! there’s no stopping here,
A moment only, all will disappear.

There, look, on the horizon see the curtain rise!
The dawn is dreaming night has reached an end.
The crimson lips are parting and they send
Sweet drafts of breath across the skies:
Then suddenly, the leaping eye a blaze of light,
Day like a god begins its royal flight!
