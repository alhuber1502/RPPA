Justice by the Hand

Those who have the reputation of honourable men in the town
are the thieves who plundered all my linen in its whiteness,
who splattered the muck across my finest clothing,
who ripped into shreds all my daily working dress.
Where I used to live not a stone was left standing,
without hearth or shelter I wandered through the silent lands,
on the empty plain I slept with the hares in the hedgerows,
and my children, my darlings, all were dying slowly
till hunger swept them all away within his brutal hands.
And I remained dishonoured, till my days were gone and withered,
and left me a bed of despair, of thistle and thorn,
while the hard foxes, the bad and black-blooded foxes,
dreamed on their pillows of down from night until morn.

I cried “Judges, now save me” — but vain was my pleading,
they laughed at my sorrow, my justice was sold;
“Great God now hear me,” I cried, cried imploring,
but God could not hear, so high is His kingdom, so high and so cold.
Then, like a she-wolf, a wolf both rabid and wounded,
I took my steel sickle with one angry twitch of the arm,
and I paced along slowly ... and the grass was unhearing,
the moon well-obscured, and the wicked slept softly
together, and their well-feathered pillow was warm.

I looked at them calmly, and then, with both hands extended,
with one slash, with one only, I left them all dead,
and then till the coming of light I sat in contentment,
awaiting the dawn in peace by the side of their bed.

And then, and then alone, was justice just fulfilled,
I upon them, and the law upon them, the law in my hand that killed.
