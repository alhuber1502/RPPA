Song

[‘My heart is like the failing hearth’]

My heart is like the failing hearth
 Now by my side,
 One by one its bursts of flame
 Have burnt and died;
 There are none to watch the sinking blaze,
 And none to care,
 Or if it kindle into strength,
 Or waste in air. 
My fate is as yon faded wreath
 Of summer flowers:
 They’ve spent their store of fragrant health
 In sunny hours,
 Which recked them not, which heeded not
 When they were dead –
 Other flowers, unwarned by them,
 Will spring instead. 
And my own heart is as the lute
 I am now waking;
 Wound to too fine and high a pitch,
 They both are breaking. 
And of their song what memory
 Will stay behind? 
An echo, like a passing thought,
 Upon the wind. 
Silence, forgetfulness, and rust,
 Lute, are for thee –
 And such my lot – neglect, the grave,
 These are for me.
