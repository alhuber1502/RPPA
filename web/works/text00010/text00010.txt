Three Years She Grew

Three years she grew in sun and shower,
 Then Nature said: ‘A lovelier flower
 On earth was never sown –
 This child I to myself will take,
 She shall be mine, and I will make
 A lady of my own. 

Myself will to my darling be
 Both law and impulse, and with me
 The girl – in rock and plain,
 In earth and heaven, in glade and bower –
 Shall feel an overseeing power
 To kindle or restrain. 

She shall be sportive as the fawn
 That wild with glee across the lawn
 Or up the mountain springs;
 And hers shall be the breathing balm,
 And hers the silence and the calm,
 Of mute insensate things. 

The floating clouds their state shall lend
 To her, for her the willow bend;
 Nor shall she fail to see
 Even in the motions of the storm
 Grace that shall mould the maiden’s form
 By silent sympathy. 

The stars of midnight shall be dear
 To her, and she shall lean her ear
 In many a secret place
 Where rivulets dance their wayward round,
 And beauty born of murmuring sound
 Shall pass into her face. 

And vital feelings of delight
 Shall rear her form to stately height,
 Her virgin bosom swell –
 Such thoughts to Lucy I will give
 While she and I together live
 Here in this happy dell.’ 

Thus Nature spake: the work was done. 
How soon my Lucy’s race was run! 
She died – and left to me
 This heath, this calm and quiet scene,
 The memory of what has been
 And never more will be.
