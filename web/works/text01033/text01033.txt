Bertran de Born

High up on the craggy mountain
smokes in ruins Autafort,
and in chains the castle s master
stands before his royal lord:
“Is it you who wrought sedition
everywhere with song and sword,
who incited loyal children
to defy their father’s word?

Did the man that here confronts me
boast with infinite conceit
that he never needed more than
half his spirit, half his wit?
Now that half cannot deliver
you, invoke the whole of it
that it may rebuild your castle,
break your chains, and make you quit!”

“As you say, my king and master,
you confront Bertran de Bom,
who once with a song incited
Périgord and Ventidom,
who was in the mighty ruler’s
royal flesh a constant thorn,
for whose sake the king’s own children
bore their father’s wrath and scorn.

In a festive hall your daughter
sat and dined, a ducal bride,
when she heard the song that I had
in a messenger confided,
and he sang the poet’s longing,
all that once had been her pride,
till her glistening bridal jewels
shone with tears she could not hide.

In the olive’s sleepy shadow
your best son could sleep no more
when he heard my messengers
singing angry songs of war.
Quickly his own steed was saddled,
and the banner that I bore
led him to the deadly arrow
at the portal of Montfort.

In my arms he rested bleeding;
not the icy, cutting steel —
that he died cursed by his father
was the pain he had to feel.
How he wished to stretch his right hand
over ocean, hill, and dale;
finding that he could not reach yours,
he pressed mine with dying zeal.

Then, like Autafort, in ruins
on the rock, my strength did fail;
not the whole, nor even half that,
neither sword nor strings stayed hale.
Easily you chained the body
since my spirit dwells in jail;
wit is gone, the only poem
that remains now is to wail.”

And the king inclined his forehead:
“My own son you led to death,
charmed the heart of my poor daughter,
now my own heart is unnerved.
Take my hand, friend of my dead son,
and the pardon he deserved!
Off then with the fetters! Of your
spirit I have felt a breath.”
