There is a Charming Land ...

There is a charming land   
Where grow the wide-armed beeches
   By the salt eastern strand. 
Old Denmark, so we call
   These rolling hills and valleys,
 And this is Freia’s Hall. 

Here sat in days of yore
   The warriors in armor,
 Well rested from the war. 
They scattered all their foes,
 And now beneath great barrows
   Their weary bones repose. 

The land is lovely still,
 With blue engirdling ocean
   And verdant vale and hill,
 Fair women, comely maids,
 Strong men and lads are dwelling
   In Denmark’s island glades.
