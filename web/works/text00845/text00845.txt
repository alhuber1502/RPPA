[1651 "A Word made Flesh is seldom"]

A Word made Flesh is seldom
And tremblingly partook
Nor then perhaps reported
But have I not mistook
Each one of us has tasted
With ecstasies of stealth
The very food debated
To our specific strength —

A Word that breathes distincdy
Fîas not the power to die
Cohesive as the Spirit
It may expire if He —
“Made Flesh and dwelt among us”
Could condescension be
Like this consent of Language
This loved Philology.
