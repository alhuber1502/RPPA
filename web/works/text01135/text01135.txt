Ecstasy

I walked the shore alone, one starlit night.
No sea-sails, and no sky-clouds were in sight.
My eyes delved further than the real world goes.
The woods, the hills, and nature all around
Appeared to question with a muffled sound
The skies’ flames, the seas’ flows.

And, bowing down their crowns of golden fire,
The endless legions of the starry choir —
A thousand varying voices in accord — H
And, curling the white spray down from their crest,
All the blue waves who never submit or rest —
Cried: “It is God the Lord!”
