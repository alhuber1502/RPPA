Psyche

[Canto VI., st. 58-60]

LVIII.

With fond embrace she clasped her long lost son,
 And gracefully received his lovely bride:
 ‘Psyche! thou hardly hast my favour won!’ 
With roseate smile her Heavenly parent cried,
 ‘Yet hence thy charms immortal, deified,
 With the young Joys, thy future offspring fair,
 Shall bloom for ever at thy lover’s side! 
All-ruling Jove’s high mandate I declare –
 Blest denizen of Heaven, arise its joys to share!’ 

LIX.

She ceased, and lo! a thousand voices, joined
 In sweetest chorus, Love’s high triumph sing;
 There, with the Graces and the Hours entwined,
 His fairy train their rosy garlands bring,
 Or round their mistress sport on halcyon wing;
 While she enraptured lives in his dear eye,
 And drinks immortal love from that pure spring
 Of never-failing full felicity,
 Bathed in ambrosial showers of bliss eternally! 

LX.

Dreams of delight, farewell – your charms no more
 Shall gild the hours of solitary gloom! 
The page remains, but can the page restore
 The vanished bowers which Fancy taught to bloom? 
Ah, no! her smiles no longer can illume
 The path my Psyche treads no more for me. 
Consigned to dark oblivion’s silent tomb,
 The visionary scenes no more I see,
 Fast from the fading lines the vivid colours flee!
