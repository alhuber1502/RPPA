Scorn Not the Sonnet

Scorn not the sonnet! Critic, you have frowned
 Mindless of its just honours. With this key
 Shakespeare unlocked his heart, the melody
 Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch’s wound;
 A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound;
 With it Camöens soothed an exile’s grief. 
The sonnet glittered a gay myrtle-leaf
 Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned
 His visionary brow – a glow-worm lamp. 
It cheered mild Spenser, called from Faery-land
 To struggle through dark ways, and, when a damp
 Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand
 The thing became a trumpet, whence he blew
 Soul-animating strains – alas, too few!
