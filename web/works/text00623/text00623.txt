The Aeronaut

The aeronaut breaks the strong bonds which hold back the spirited impulse of the Montgolfier balloonist and, blinded by insanity, with him he is about to soar into space. Rising to a certain height, his daring grows and the fearless pilot throws over all the ballast and strives to scale the heavens. A fantastical illusion! In a short while, guess what happens? The light gas which gives life to the balloon, fugitive seeps away and, most often, the man finds a certain death in his fall. Is it not true that the ambitious man also seems like the aeronaut? Both always seek the heights and both, rising up, lose all.
