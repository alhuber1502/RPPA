Withdrawal

Let me be, World, let me be!
Do not tempt me with love’s gifts!
Let this heart alone retain
Its own bliss and its own pain!

What I mourn for I don’t know:
Some unrecognized regret;
Teats forever dim my sight
Of the sun’s beloved light.

Often when I’m least aware
Joy will send its brightening flash
Through what made me so oppressed
Blissfully into my breast.

Let me be, World, let me be!
Do not tempt me with love’s gifts!
Let this heart alone retain
Its own bliss and its own pain!
