Rima LXXIII: They closed her eyes ...

They closed her eyes
   That were still open;
 They hid her face
   With a white linen,
 And, some sobbing,
 Others in silence,
 From the sad bedroom   
All came away. 

The nightlight in a dish   
Burned on the floor;
 It threw on the wall   
The bed’s shadow,
 And in the shadow   
One saw sometime   
Drawn in sharp line
   The body’s shape. 

The dawn appeared. 
At its first whiteness
   With its thousand noises
   The town awoke. 
Before that contract
   Of light and darkness,   
Of life and strangeness
   I thought a moment. 
My God, how lonely   
The dead are! 

On the shoulders of men   
To church they bore her,   
And in a chapel   
They left her bier. 
There they surrounded   
Her pale body   
With yellow candles
   And black stuffs. 

At the last stroke
   Of the ringing for the Souls,
   An old crone finished   
Her last prayers. 
She crossed the narrow nave,
   The doors moaned,
 And the holy place   
Remained deserted. 

From a clock one heard   
The measured ticking,
 And from a candle   
The guttering. 
All things there
 Were so dark and mournful,
 So cold and rigid,
 That I thought a moment;
 My God, how lonely
 The dead are! 

From the high belfry
   The tongue of iron
   Clanged, giving out
   A last farewell. 
Crape on their clothes,
 Her friends and kindred
   Passed in a line
   In homage to her. 

In the last vault
   Dark and narrow,
 The pickaxe opened
 A niche at one end;
 They laid her away there. 
Soon they bricked the place up. 
And with a gesture
   Bade grief farewell. 

Pickaxe on shoulder   
The gravedigger,
 Singing between his teeth,
 Passed out of sight. 
The night came down,
 It was all silent. 
Alone in the darkness
   I thought a moment, —
 My God, how lonely   
The dead are! 

In the dark nights
   Of bitter winter,
 When the wind makes   
The raster creak,
 When the violent rain
   Lashes the windows. 
Lonely I remember
   That poor girl. 

There falls the rain   
With its noise eternal,
 There the northwind   
Fights with the rain. 
Stretched in the hollow
   Of the damp bricks,
 Perhaps her bones
   Freeze with the cold. 

Does the dust return to dust? 
Does the soul fly to heaven? 
Or is all vile matter,
 Rottenness, filthiness? 
I know not, but
 There is something — something —   
Something which give me
   Loathing, terror, —
 To leave the dead   
So alone, so wretched.
