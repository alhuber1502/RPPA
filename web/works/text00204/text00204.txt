To the Earl of Egremont

[Sonnet XVIII.]

Wyndham! ’tis not thy blood, though pure it runs
 Through a long line of glorious ancestry,
 Percys and Seymours, Britain’s boasted sons,
 Who trust the honours of their race to thee. 

’Tis not thy splendid domes (where Science loves
 To touch the canvas, and the bust to raise),
 Thy rich domains, fair fields, and spreading groves –
 ’Tis not all these the Muse delights to praise:

In birth, and wealth, and honours, great thou art! 
But nobler in thy independent mind,
 And in that liberal hand and feeling heart
 Given thee by Heaven – a blessing to mankind! 
Unworthy oft may titled fortune be:
 A soul like thine – is true Nobility!
