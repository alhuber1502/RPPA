Anach Cuain

If my health is spared I'll be long relating
 Of the number who drowned from Anach Cuain. 
And the keening after of mother and father
 And child by the harbour, the mournful croon! 
King of Graces, who died to save us,
 T'were a small affair but for one or two,
 But a boat-load bravely in calm day sailing
 Without storm or rain to be swept to doom. 

What wild despair was on all the faces
 To see them there in the light of day,
 In every place there was lamentation,
 And tearing of hair as the wreck was shared. 
And boys there lying when crops were ripening,
 From the strength of life they were borne to clay
 In their wedding clothes for their wake they robed them
 O King of Glory, man's hope is in vain.
