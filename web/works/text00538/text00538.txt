Caprices

[First part X, LXXX, CXXXV; Second part XI, CLXIV, CLXXI, CCXXXI]

All in love is sadness; yet, sad, and in all, it is the best we have.

Conscience at the end of our life is a maze without exit.

It is my stated faith that I adore God even though he gave me life.

The daughters of the mothers whom I loved so much kiss me now as they would a saint.

I betrayed you as you betrayed me, it is well done. Vengeance, in Spain, is a right.

I sought knowledge and it showed me nothingness, I acquired love and conquered weariness.

Coming from not being, I am unsure whether I am going anywhere. The mysteries of the grave and the cradle, phantoms of the past and the future!
