To a Butterfly

Stay near me, do not take thy flight! 
A little longer stay in sight –
 Much reading do I find in thee,
 Historian of my infancy. 
Float near me, do not yet depart! 
Dead times revive in thee;
 Thou bringest (gay creature, as thou art)
 A solemn image to my heart:
 My father’s family. 

Oh pleasant, pleasant were the days,
 The time when in our childish plays
 My sister Emmeline and I
 Together chased the butterfly. 
A very hunter, I did rush
 Upon the prey – with leaps and springs
 I followed on from brake to bush –
 But she, God love her, feared to brush
 The dust from off its wings!
