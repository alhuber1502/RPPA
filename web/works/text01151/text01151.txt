Sonnet.

To Ronsard.

For a friend who was publishing an edition of that poet.

To you, Ronsard, to you, whom injurious fate
Has locked for two centuries in historyâ€™s scorn,
My hands lift up this purifying offering;
Your odious disgrace I come to expiate.

Not that I hope to restore your memory high
On the radiant throne where you formerly reigned;
From such a depth such glory cannot be regained;
Not with impunity did Vulcan fall from the sky.

But may a little pity at last console your shade;
And may your once famous name, now long reviled
With vulgar sneers, come closer to its former state.

You dared too much, but your audacity was fine;
You wearied without defeating a rebellious tongue,
And since then greater work is done by men less great.
