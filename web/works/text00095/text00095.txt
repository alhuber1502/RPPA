Despondency,

An Ode

I.

Oppressed with grief, oppressed with care,
 A burden more than I can bear,
 I set me down and sigh;
 Oh life! thou art a galling load,
 Along a rough, a weary road,
 To wretches such as I! 
Dim-backward as I cast my view,
 What sickening scenes appear –
 What sorrows yet may pierce me through,
 Too justly I may fear! 
Still caring, despairing,
 Must be my bitter doom;
 My woes here shall close ne’er
 But with the closing tomb! 

II.

Happy ye sons of busy life
 Who, equal to the bustling strife,
 No other view regard
 (Even when the wish
                ed
               end’s denied,
 Yet while the busy means are plied,
 They bring their own reward);
 Whilst I, a hope-abandoned wight,
 Unfitted with an aim,
 Meet every sad returning night
 And joyless morn the same. 
You, bustling and justling,
 Forget each grief and pain;
 I, listless yet restless,
 Find every prospect vain! 

III.

How blest the solitary’s lot,
 Who, all-forgetting, all-forgot,
 Within his humble cell –
 The cavern wild with tangling roots –
 Sits o’er his newly-gathered fruits,
 Beside his crystal well! 
Or haply to his evening thought,
 By unfrequented stream,
 The ways of men are distant brought,
 A faint-collected dream;
 While praising, and raising
 His thoughts to Heaven on high,
 As wandering, meandering,
 He views the solemn sky. 

IV.

Than I, no lonely hermit, placed
 Where never human footstep traced,
 Less fit to play the part:
 The lucky moment to improve,
 And just to stop, and just to move,
 With self-respecting art. 
But ah, those pleasures, loves, and joys,
 Which I too keenly taste,
 The solitary can despise –
 Can want and yet be blest! 
He needs not, he heeds not
 Or human love, or hate;
 Whilst I here must cry here
 At perfidy ingrate! 

V.

Oh enviable early days,
 When dancing thoughtless pleasure’s maze,
 To care, to guilt unknown –
 How ill exchanged for riper times,
 To feel the follies or the crimes
 Of others, or my own! 
Ye tiny elves that guiltless sport,
 Like linnets in the bush,
 Ye little know the ills ye court,
 When manhood is your wish! 
The losses, the crosses
 That active man engage;
 The fears all, the tears all
 Of dim declining age!
