Holy Willie’s Prayer

Oh thou that in the heavens does dwell,
 Wha, as it pleases best thysel,
 Sends ane to Heaven and ten to Hell,
 A’ for thy glory –
 And no for ony gude or ill
 They’ve done before thee! 

I bless and praise thy matchless might,
 When thousands thou hast left in night,
 That I am here before thy sight,
 For gifts and grace,
 A burning and a shining light
 To a’ this place! 

What was I, or my generation,
 That should get such exaltation? 
I, wha deserved most just damnation
 For broken laws
 Sax thousand years ere my creation,
 Through Adam’s cause! 

When from my mother’s womb I fell,
 Thou might hae plunged me deep in Hell,
 To gnash my gooms, and weep, and wail,
 In burning lakes,
 Where damn
                ed
               devils roar and yell
 Chained to their stakes. 

Yet I am here, a chosen sample,
 To show thy grace is green and ample:
 I’m here, a pillar of thy temple
 Strong as a rock,
 A guide, a ruler and example
 To a’ thy flock! 

Oh Lord thou kens what zeal I bear,
 When drinkers drink, and swearers swear,
 And singin’ there and dancin’ here,
 Wi’ great an’ sma’;
 For I am keepet by thy fear,
 Free frae them a’. 

But yet, oh Lord (confess I must),
 At times I’m fashed wi’ fleshly lust;
 And sometimes too, in warldly trust
 Vile self gets in! 
But thou remembers we are dust,
 Defiled wi’ sin! 

Oh Lord – yestreen – thou kens – wi’ Meg –
 Thy pardon I sincerely beg! 
Oh may’t ne’er be a living plague,
 To my dishonour,
 And I’ll never lift a lawless leg
 Again upon her! 

Besides, I farther maun avow,
 Wi’ Leezi’s lass, three times – I trow –
 But Lord, that friday I was fou
 When I cam near her;
 Or else, thou kens, thy servant true
 Wad never steer her. 

Maybe thou lets this fleshly thorn
 Buffet thy servant even and morn,
 Lest he over proud and high should turn,
 That he’s sae gifted;
 If sae, thy hand maun even be borne
 Until thou lift it. 

Lord bless thy chosen in this place –
 For here thou has a chosen race –
 But God, confound their stubborn face,
 And blast their name,
 Wha bring thy rulers to disgrace
 And open shame! 

Lord mind Gaun Hamilton’s deserts! 
He drinks, and swears, and plays at cartes,
 Yet has sae mony taking arts
 Wi’ great and sma’,
 Frae God’s ain priest the people’s hearts
 He steals awa. 

And when we chastened him therefore,
 Thou kens how he bred sic a splore,
 And set the warld in a roar
 O’ laughin’ at us:
 Curse thou his basket and his store,
 Kail and potatoes! 

Lord hear my earnest cry and prayer
 Against that Presbytry of Ayr! 
Thy strong right hand, Lord, make it bare
 Upon their heads! 
Lord visit them, and dinna spare,
 For their misdeeds! 

Oh Lord my God, that glib-tongued Aiken! 
My very heart and flesh are quaking
 To think how I sat, sweating, shaking,
 And pissed wi’ dread,
 While Auld wi’ hingin lip gaed sneaking
 And hid his head! 

Lord, in thy day o’ vengeance try him! 
Lord visit him that did employ him! 
And pass not in thy mercy by them,
 Nor hear their prayer;
 But for thy people’s sake destroy them,
 And dinna spare! 

But Lord, remember me and mine
 Wi’ mercies temporal and divine! 
That I for grace and gear may shine,
 Excelled by nane! 
And a’ the glory shall be thine! 
Amen! Amen!
