Within Their Silent, Perfect Glass

Within their silent, perfect glass
 The mirror waters, vast and clear,
 Reflect the silhouette of rocks,
 Dark faces brooding on the shore. 

Within their silent, perfect glass
 The mirror waters show the sky;
 Clouds skim across the mirrorâ€™s face,
 And dim its surface as they die. 

Within their silent, perfect glass
 The mirror waters image storm;
 They glow with lightning, but the blasts
 Of thunder do not mar their calm. 

These mirror waters, as before,
 Still lie in silence, vast and clear. 

They mirror me, I mirror them,
 As true as glass as they I am;
 And as I turn away I leave
 The images that gave them form. 

Dark rocks must menace from the shore,
 And thunderheads grow large with rain;
 Lightning must flash above the lake,
 And I must mirror and pass on,
 Onward and onward without end.
