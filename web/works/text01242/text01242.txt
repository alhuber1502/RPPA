You will say of these verses ...

You will say of these verses, and itâ€™s true,
that their harmony is odd, unusual,
that their ideas have a pallid brilliance
like floating wood-ash
crackling, for a second,
and vanishing at once,
seeding itself in the uncertain half-mist
that curls around the bottom of the garden,
or in the monotonous soughing of the pine-woods
by the wild shores of the sea.

And I will say to you only that these songs of mine
come in their confusion from my heart
as, from the deepest thicket in the oakwood
at the opening of the day
comes a sound that no-one knows:
a murmur of the wind
or the flowers kissing
or some pastoral and mysterious music, which,
in this world of sighs,
falls lost on its pilgrim-road to the stars.
