The Tomb of My Brother:

 Ode.

The current of time thrusts the years along. But where is its source? In which sea does it deposit the years and the centuries of which we are robbed? If man were given to sink his gaze into the dark cavern which the past has swallowed, perhaps from there he might succeed in seeing a future eternity. It would embrace the mysterious sphere of knowledge and virtue and would measure the final point of the enchanted path which guides human souls to its perfection. Why does the cold marble not show me the silent outline of my dear brother? Death with powerful hand thrust this slab between us! He sighed within it while night enfolded over me its dark mantle and the complaining wind left the cypresses in repose. The moon, which sent a weak ray at that moment, illuminated the tomb, making the shadows lengthen, giving light to my dejected eyes. I saw then a butterfly raise itself up in uncertain flight as if it came as a consolation to my sorrow and give me respite and dry my tears as if to say: ‘He who mourns the dead, admire my happiness. I have conquered the fierce Parcae (the three Fates = death) as day does night. My life has summed three lives. I was once an inert grub and today I fly in the light like the dawn, death in its tomb improves my existence, it gives me a life of love, it gilds my wings.’ Ah! Beautiful butterfly, guide me by the stair of hope which reaches to the highest star from the earth and raises up humans from one world to another!
