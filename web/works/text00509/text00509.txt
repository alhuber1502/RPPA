Stephen the Great’s Mother

I

On a rugged black rock, in a castle old,
 Where a tiny river through the valley rolled,
 Was a sobbing princess, whose sad tears did sink
 As rain among petals of a sweet soft pink. 
Off to a great battle, her husband had gone,
 Leading his brave army and left her forlorn. 
Her blue eyes they fill now with droplets anew,
 As sweet violets’ petals are covered with dew. 
Golden locks fall over her bosom so white,
 Roses and sweet lilies on her brow unite. 

II

Suddenly at midnight fearful strikes the clock,
 At the castle gate now who doth loudly knock? 
‘It is I, dear mother, your belovèd son,
 I return from battle, but return all done. 
Cruel this our fortune for once it hath been:
 My outnumbered army is scattered unseen. 
Open the gate wide, though, the Turks me surround,
 Sore the wounds I suffer, the wind’s cold around.’ 

III

Heading for the window the young princess flies,
 ‘Careful, young lady!’, the old queen then cries. 
In the dark of night to the gate she makes way;
 To her son in sorrow this speech does she say:
 ‘Mark my words, thou stranger, my Stephen’s away,
 His brave arm in battle thousands doth it slay. 
I to him am mother, he son is to me;
 If you be that person, you had better flee. 
Should God in his heaven now take me to him,
 My years crown with sorrow, my old eyes grow dim,
 Should thy soul, so noble, have gone all astray,
 Should you be my Stephen, to thee thus I say:
 Come you not as victor, come here not at all,
 Your will, if it cross mine, shall ne’er stand, but fall! 
Go! Go, lead your army, and die for your nation;
 Flowers round your tombstone will be your oblation.’ 

IV

Back into dire battle Stephen blows his horn,
 His army re-forms now, that once was forlorn. 
Resuming the struggle, their foe is struck down,
 As a scythe through wheat-stalks, the hillside is mown.
