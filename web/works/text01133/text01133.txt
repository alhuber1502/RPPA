The Captive Girl

If I were not a captive
I’d come to like this land,
This sea that sounds so plaintive,
These fields of golden maize,
And these stars without number —
If along the gloomy rampart
No glints shone in the darkness
From the sabres of spahis. 

I’m not a Tartar girl
Who needs a black eunuch
To tune me my guitar
Or hold my mirror for me.
Far away from these Sodoms
In the land where we belong
One may speak at evening
With the young gentlemen.

And yet I like a seashore
Where winter’s frigid breath
Never blows into your room
Through the open casements.
The rain is warm in summer;
The green wandering insect
Glimmers like an emerald
Under green blades of grass.

This Smyrna is a princess
With a lovely flower-crown;
Happy springtime never stops
Responding to her call,
And, like a smiling group
Of blossoms in a bowl,
Brightly shining in her seas
Are archipelagoes.

I like these crimson towers,
These streamers proudly flying,
These golden houses, seeming
The playthings of a child;
I also like, when my thoughts
Require gentler solacing,
These pavilions that balance
On the backs of elephants.

In this enchanted palace,
My heart, when full of music,
Thinks it hears, in voices
Coming from the deserts,
The stifled sounds of genies
Blending the harmonies
Of the infinite songs
They sing into the winds.

I also Like this country’s
Sweetly burning incense,
The foliage that quivers
Around the golden windows,
The spring that pours out water
binder the leaning palm tree,
And the white stork that stands
On the white minarets.

Sitting on a bed of moss
I like to sing a Spanish air,
While tny sweet companions,
A vagabond troupe whose feet
Gracefully skim the ground,
Whose laughter overflows
As their dance whirls around
Under round parasols.

But most of all when touched
By the fluttering breeze,
I like to sit at nighttime
And dream while I am sitting,
My eye upon the deep sea,
While pale and fair the moon
Unfolds among the waves
Her silver fan.
