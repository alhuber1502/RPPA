Dream-Pedlary

I

If there were dreams to sell,
 What would you buy? 
Some cost a passing bell;
 Some a light sigh,
 That shakes from Life’s fresh crown
 Only a roseleaf down. 
If there were dreams to sell,
 Merry and sad to tell,
 And the crier rung the bell,
 What would you buy? 

II

A cottage lone and still,
 With bowers nigh,
 Shadowy, my woes to still,
 Until I die. 
Such pearl from Life’s fresh crown
 Fain would I shake me down. 
Were dreams to have at will,
 This would best heal my ill,
 This would I buy. 

III

But there were dreams to sell,
 Ill didst thou buy;
 Life is a dream, they tell,
 Waking, to die. 
Dreaming a dream to prize,
 Is wishing ghosts to rise;
 And, if I had the spell
 To call the buried, well,
 Which one would I? 

IV

If there are ghosts to raise,
 What shall I call,
 Out of hell’s murky haze,
 Heaven’s blue hall? 
Raise my loved longlost boy
 To lead me to his joy. 
There are no ghosts to raise;
 Out of death lead no ways;
 Vain is the call. 

V

Know’st thou not ghosts to sue? 
No love thou hast. 
Else lie, as I will do,
 And breathe thy last. 
So out of Life’s fresh crown
 Fall like a rose-leaf down. 
Thus are the ghosts to woo;
 Thus are all dreams made true,
 Ever to last!
