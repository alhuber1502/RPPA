The Visit

Askest, ‘How long thou shalt stay,’
Devastator of the day?
Know, each substance, and relation,
Thorough nature’s operation,
Hath its unit, bound, and metre;
And every new compound
Is some product and repeater, —
Product of the early found.
But the unit of the visit,
The encounter of the wise, —
Say, what other metre is it
Than the meeting of the eyes?
Nature poureth into nature
Through the channels of that feature.
Riding on the ray of sight,
More fleet than waves or whirlwinds go,
Or for service, or delight,
Hearts to hearts their meaning show,
Sum their long experience,
And import intelligence.
Single look has drained the breast;
Single moment years confessed.
The duration of a glance
Is the term of covenance,
And, though thy rede be church or state,
Frugal multiples of that.
Speeding Saturn cannot halt;
Linger, — thou shalt rue the fault;
If Love his moment overstay,
Hatred’s swift repulsions play.
