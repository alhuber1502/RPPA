My illness is incurable ...

My illness is incurable,
this illness born with me,
and it will take me to the grave
my illness-enemy.

Surgeons, healers of the village,
doctors with your cap and gown,
for the sickness which afflicts me
no remedy on earth is known.

Cease then, from your reading over,
conscientiously or not,
all the volumes of your science,
nothing for me they have got.

You doubt it? Do not doubt it,
what I tell you of my ills:
after all there still are pains which
will not go away with pills.

Anger, oh, because I tell you
what you realize, in the end?
Well, find out ... get to work, then,
come and try to cure me, friend.

All that illness, all that anguish,
simply is my heart —
cut it out without compassion —
after that make my life start.
