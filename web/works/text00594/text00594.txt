The Oak Trees

[II]

Under the implacable blades of the axe how swiftly holm oak and oak tree crash to the ground! And under the beams of smiling dawn how bare the crests of the hills appear!

That which yesteryear was woods and groves both wild and overgrown, where mists floated wrapped in sweet mystery as dawn appeared, and the serene springs bubbled up hidden between flowers and mosses, today are arid slopes which display their deformed and blackened stumps. Birds no longer fill them with their songs of love, norgather together when the May dawn breaks through the naked foliage which remain of the oaks, only the passing echo of the croaking raven and the wolf who howls.
