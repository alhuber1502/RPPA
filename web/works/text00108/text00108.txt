A Red Red Rose

O my luve’s like a red, red rose,
 That’s newly sprung in June;
 O my luve’s like the melodie
 That’s sweetly played in tune:

As fair art thou, my bonnie lass,
 So deep in luve am I;
 And I will love thee still, my dear,
 Till a’ the seas gang dry –

Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,
 And the rocks melt wi’ the sun –
 I will love thee still, my dear,
 While the sands o’ life shall run! 

And fare thee weel, my only luve,
 And fare thee weel, a while –
 And I will come again, my luve,
 Tho’ it were ten thousand mile!
