To H. C., Six Years Old

Oh thou whose fancies from afar are brought,
 Who of thy words dost make a mock apparel,
 And fittest to unutterable thought
 The breeze-like motion and the self-born carol;
 Thou fairy voyager, that dost float
 In such clear water, that thy boat
 May rather seem
 To brood on air that on an earthly stream –
 Suspended in a stream as clear as sky,
 Where earth and heaven do make one imagery. 
Oh bless
                ed
               vision, happy child,
 That art so exquisitely wild,
 I think of thee with many fears
 For what may be thy lot in future years. 

I thought of times when Pain might be thy guest,
 Lord of thy house and hospitality;
 And Grief – uneasy Lover – never rest
 But when she sat within the touch of thee. 
Oh too industrious folly! 
Oh vain and causeless melancholy! 
Nature will either end thee quite,
 Or, lengthening out thy season of delight,
 Preserve for thee, by individual right,
 A young lamb’s heart among the full-grown flocks. 
What hast thou to do with sorrow,
 Or the injuries of tomorrow? 
Thou art a dew-drop which the morn brings forth,
 Not doomed to jostle with unkindly shocks
 Or to be trailed along the soiling earth –
 A gem that glitters while it lives,
 And no forewarning gives,
 But, at the touch of wrong, without a strife,
 Slips in a moment out of life.
