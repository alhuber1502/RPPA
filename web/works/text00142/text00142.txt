The Fountain

We talked with open heart, and tongue
 Affectionate and true –
 A pair of friends, though I was young,
 And Matthew seventy-two. 

We lay beneath a spreading oak,
 Beside a mossy seat,
 And from the turf a fountain broke
 And gurgled at our feet. 

‘Now, Matthew, let us try to match
 This water’s pleasant tune
 With some old Border song or catch
 That suits a summer’s noon. 

Or of the church-clock and the chimes
 Sing here beneath the shade
 That half-mad thing of witty rhymes
 Which you last April made!’ 

In silence Matthew lay, and eyed
 The spring beneath the tree;
 And thus the dear old man replied,
 The grey-haired man of glee:

‘Down to the vale this water steers –
 How merrily it goes! –
 ’Twill murmur on a thousand years,
 And flow as now it flows. 

And here, on this delightful day,
 I cannot choose but think
 How oft, a vigorous man, I lay
 Beside this fountain’s brink. 

My eyes are dim with childish tears,
 My heart is idly stirred,
 For the same sound is in my ears
 Which in those days I heard. 

Thus fares it still in our decay;
 And yet the wiser mind
 Mourns less for what age takes away
 Than what it leaves behind. 

The blackbird in the summer trees,
 The lark upon the hill,
 Let loose their carols when they please,
 Are quiet when they will. 

With Nature never do they wage
 A foolish strife; they see
 A happy youth, and their old age
 Is beautiful and free. 

But we are pressed by heavy laws,
 And often – glad no more –
 We wear a face of joy, because
 We have been glad of yore. 

If there is one who need bemoan
 His kindred laid in earth,
 The household-hearts that were his own,
 It is the man of mirth. 

My days, my friend, are almost gone,
 My life has been approved,
 And many love me, but by none
 Am I enough beloved.’ 

‘Now both himself and me he wrongs,
 The man who thus complains! 
I live and sing my idle songs
 Upon these happy plains –

And, Matthew, for thy children dead
 I’ll be a son to thee!’ 
At this he grasped his hands, and said
 ‘Alas, that cannot be!’ 

We rose up from the fountain-side,
 And down the smooth descent
 Of the green sheep-track did we glide,
 And through the wood we went,

And, ere we came to Leonard’s Rock,
 He sang those witty rhymes
 About the crazy old church-clock
 And the bewildered chimes.
