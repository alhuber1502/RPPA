The Bridegroom

For three whole days the merchant’s daughter,
Natasha, disappeared;
The third night came: in wild disorder
Natasha reappeared.
Mother and father plied their questions,
Tried to bring about confessions.
Natasha doesn’t hear,
She scarcely breathes from fear.

Her mother grieved, her father grieved,
Long did they catechise her,
But when at last she was reprieved
They still were none the wiser.
Natasha won back cheer and health,
Soon she was her former self
And with her sisters sat
Outside the shingle-gate.

There she is with her companions
Beside the gate one day,
The merchant’s girl, when all at once
A troika gallops by.
Its young and dashing driver tugs
The reins of horses wrapped with rugs;
He stands up in his sleigh,
He’ll crush all in his way.

He glances at her as he drives,
Natasha glances back,
On like the wind he whirls, he leaves
Natasha thunderstruck.
Back to the house headlong she flies,
“I recognized him — him!” she cries —
“I know that it was him!
Stop him, save me from him!”

Shaking their heads, the family gather
And listen full of gloom;
“Daughter dear,” begins the father,
“Tell me the truth now, come:
If someone has offended you,
Give us some sign, and that will do.”
Natasha doesn’t speak.
All she can do is weep.

Next day, betimes, a matchmaker
Is waiting in the parlour.
She utters praises for Natasha,
Then turns towards the father:
“We’re buying — you’ve the goods for us,
And handsome is as handsome does:
The lad has strength and style,
He’s free of guile and bile.

“He's wealthy, and he’s also clever,
He doesn’t touch his cap,
Lives like a boyar, lacked he's never,
Luck falls into his lap;
He'll have a mind to give the girl
A fox-fur coat, a precious pearl,
Gold rings and necklaces
A rich-brocaded dress.

“He passed your gateway yesterday;
He isn't one that dithers,
So let's to church now — what do you say?
And take the icons with us?”
She sits and eats a plate of pie,
She talks with sighs and slanted eye,
And what the poor bride hears
Rouses her deepest fears.

“It’s settled, then,” agrees the father,
“Aren’t you the lucky one?
My dear Natasha, to the altar!
It’s dull to sit alone.
To go through life unwed is wrong,
The linnet has to leave off song,
It’s time to build a nest,
Have children and be blessed.”

Natasha leans against the wall,
She tries to speak — instead
Begins to sob and shake and wail,
Laugh as though off her head.
The matchmaker, in the disorder,
Runs to her with a flask of water
To give her a drink — then splash a
Dash of it on Natasha.

A family in calamity ...
Natasha now comes to:
“Your will is sacred, I shall be
Obedient to you.
Call my bridegroom to the feast,
Bake for a hundred guests at least,
Make mead that’s good and strong,
And bring the law along.”

“We shall now, angel of my heart!
I’d place your happiness
Before my life!” At once they start,
They bake their very best.
And now the worthy guests assemble,
And see, the bride is led to table;
The bridesmaids weep and sing —
A sleigh comes galloping.

The groom! Now everyone is present.
The goblets clash and clink,
The loving-cup is found most pleasant;
Guests take their fill of drink.
“Dear friends, I must be satisfied:
Why does my own and fairest bride
Not drink, nor eat, nor serve?
Why does my fair bride grieve?”

“I'll tell you all I have tb tell,”
To the bridegroom spoke the bride.
“My life is now a life in hell,
I weep all day and night.
An evil dream oppresses me.”
The father: “What can this dream be?
Dear daughter, if you please,
Put our minds at ease.”

“My dream was this,” she spoke out loud.
“I wandered in a wood
At night; behind a bank of cloud
A half-moon dimly stood;
I'd lost my path, and all around
No living soul, no living sound,
Nothing at all that stirs,
Only the tops of firs.

“And suddenly, as if I woke,
I saw, close by, a hut.
I knocked — no answer. Then I spoke —
The door stayed firmly shut.
I opened it, prayed, and went inside:
A candle burned, and in its light —
Gold, silver, everywhere ...
All shining, sumptuous ware.”

“How is your dream an evil one,
Foretelling wealth untold?”
“Wait, sir, till my account is done.
On silver and on gold,
And cloths and carpets and brocade,
And silken stuffs from Novgorod —
On marvels heaven-sent
I gazed in wonderment.

“Then I heard shouts, and clop clop clop ...
Up to the porch they drove.
I slammed the door — in one quick hop —
I hid behind the stove.
Soon I heard voices once again ...
Into the hut tramped twelve young men,
And with them was a maiden,
A pure and lovely maiden.

“They entered in a noisy horde,
And none took off his hat;
To table, icons quite ignored,
Without a grace they sat,
The eldest brother at their head,
The youngest brother on his right,
And on his left the maiden,
The pure and lovely maiden.

“Laughter and clamour, singing, yelling,
Unbridled merriment ...”
“How can your dream be bad, foretelling
Good fortune and content?”
“Wait, sir, till my account is done.
The din and revelry went on,
The merriment was mad,
Only the maid was sad.

“She spoke no word, she sat in grief,
Would take no food, no mead.
The eldest brother grasped his knife
And whistling, whetted it;
He glanced towards the loyely maid
He gripped her swiftly by the braid,
The villain killed her and
Cut off her right hand.”

The bridegroom, with a shrug, replied:
“But this is downright drivel!
You mustn’t grieve, beloved bride,
Your dream cannot mean evil.”
The bride is swift to answer him:
“Whose hand does it come from, then, this ring?” —
Looks him full in the face;
Each guest, starts from his place.

The ring rolls clinking on the floor,
The bridegroom has turned pale;
All is confusion. — Speaks the law:
“Bind the criminal!”
Fettered, the villain was condemned
Without delay and met his end.
Natasha’s was the glory!
And that is all our story.
