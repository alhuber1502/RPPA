Departure

In a forest near Lubowitz.

O mountains, O broad valleys,
O beautiful green woods,
You holy place of refuge
For all my joys and woes!
When outside, duped as ever,
The world goes bustling by,
Cast again your arches round me
Where your green pavilion grows.

When day begins to brighten,
The earth will glint and steam,
The birds will sing so joyfully,
Your heart will join the song:
Then let dull earthly sorrows
Disperse and blow away,
Then you again will rise up
In splendor young and strong!

There is written in the forest
A silent solemn word
On doing right and loving,
And what we must hold dear.
I have read them truly,
These plain and simple lines,
And they throughout my being
Grew wonderfully clear.

Too soon I must forsake you,
Go a stranger to strange lands,
In bright and crowded alleys
To watch lifeâ€™s show unfold;
And midst this scene so shallow
Will come your solemn strength
To lift me in my solitude
Lest my heart grow old.
