The Graves of a Household

They grew in beauty, side by side,
 They filled one home with glee –
 Their graves are severed, far and wide,
 By mount, and stream, and sea. 

The same fond mother bent at night
 O’er each fair sleeping brow;
 She had each folded flower in sight –
 Where are those dreamers now? 
One, midst the forests of the west,

By a dark stream is laid –
 The Indian knows his place of rest,
 Far in the cedar-shade. 
The sea, the blue lone sea, hath one,
 He lies where pearls lie deep:

He was the loved of all, yet none
 O’er his low bed may weep! 
One sleeps where southern vines are dressed
 Above the noble slain:
 He wrapped his colours round his breast,

On a blood-red field of Spain. 
And one – o’er her the myrtle showers
 Its leaves, by soft winds fanned –
 She faded midst Italian flowers
 The last of that bright band. 

And parted thus they rest, who played
 Beneath the same green tree;
 Whose voices mingled as they prayed
 Around one parent knee! 

They that with smiles lit up the hall,
 And cheered with song the hearth –
 Alas for love, if thou wert all,
 And nought beyond, oh Earth!
