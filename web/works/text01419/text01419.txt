Hadji Dimiter

He lives, still he lives! In the mountain fast,
 soaked in blood, he lies and groans,
 a rebel, wounded in the chest,
 a rebel, young and with a manly strength. 

To one side he has thrown a gun,
 to the other a sword in broken pieces,
 his head rolls, his eyes are dulled,
 his mouth describes the universe with curses. 

The rebel lies, and in the sky
 there burns a motionless and angry sun;
 a harvester sings in fields near by,
 and faster still his lifeblood runs. 

It’s harvest now. Slave girls – chant
 your songs of grief. And you, sun, shine
 upon this land of slaves. My heart
 be hushed. One rebel more will die. 

He who falls while fighting to be free
 can never die: for him the sky
 and earth, the trees and beasts shall keen,
 to him the minstrel’s song shall rise …

By day he’s shaded by an eagle,
 a wolf licks gently at his wounds,
 above, a falcon – bird of rebels –
 tends to this rebel as a brother would. 

The moon comes out and day grows dim,
 on heaven’s vault the stars now throng,
 the forest rustles, quiet stirs the wind,
 the mountains sing an outlaw song. 

Wood-sprites, in their white-hued dress,
 fair and beautiful, take up the tune,
 hushed their footfall in the grass,
 as all about him then sit down. 

One sprinkles coolness over him,
 another binds his wound with herbs,
 a third’s quick kisses touch his lips
 and softly smiles as he looks up at her. 

Where is Karadja? – sister, say. 
Where is my faithful company? 
Tell me, then bear my soul away –
 sister, this is where I want to die. 

Enraptured then they all embrace
 and heavenwards fly, still singing on
 they fly and sing till morning overtakes
 their quest to find Karadja’s soul …

On the mountainside – as day has dawned –
 the rebel lies, his lifeblood runs,
 the wolf licks at his bitter wound
 and the sun, again, now burns – and burns.
