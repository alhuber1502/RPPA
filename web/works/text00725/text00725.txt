The Origin of Man

I.

Man has forgot his Origin; in vain
He searches for the record of his race
In ancient books, or seeks with toil to gain
From the deep cave, or rocks some primal trace.
And some have fancied, from a higher sphere,
Forgetful of his origin he came;
To dwell awhile a wandering exile here
Subject to sense, another, yet the same.
With mind bewildered, weak how should he know
The Source Divine from whom his being springs?
The darkened spirit does its shadow throw
On written record, and on outward things;
That else might plainly to his thought reveal
The wondrous truths, which now they but conceal.

II.

Not suffering for their sins in former state,
As some have taught, their system to explain;
Nor hither sent, as by the sport of fate,
Souls that nor memory, nor love retain,
Do men into this world of nature come;
But born of God; though earthy, frail and weak;
Nor all unconscious of a heavenly home.
Which they through trial, suffering, here must seek.
A heavenly Guide has come the way to show,
To lead us to the Fatherâ€™s house above;
From Him he came, to Him, he said, I go;
Oh may we heed the message of his love!
That we no more in darkness, doubt, may roam,
But find while here we dwell our heavenly home.
