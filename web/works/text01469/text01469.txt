Pantomime

Pierrot, no sentimental swain,
 Washes a pâté down again
 With furtive flagons, white and red. 

Cassandre, to chasten his content,
 Greets with a tear of sentiment
   His nephew disinherited. 

That blackguard of a Harlequin   
Pirouettes, and plots to win
 His Colombine that flits and flies. 

Colombine dreams, and starts to find
   A sad heart sighing in the wind,
 And in her heart a voice that sighs.
