A Clymene

Mystical strains unheard,
 A song without a word,
   Dearest, because thine eyes,
   Pale as the skies,

Because thy voice, remote   
As the far clouds that float   
Veiling for me the whole   
Heaven of the soul,

Because the stately scent
   Of thy swan’s whiteness, blent   
With the white lily’s bloom   
Of thy perfume,

Ah, because thy dear love,
 The music breathed above   
By angels halo-crowned,
 Odor and sound,

Hath, in my subtle heart,
 With some mysterious art
   Transposed thy harmony,
 So let it be.
