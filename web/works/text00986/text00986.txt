The Sanctimonious Poets

Cold hypocrites, of gods do not dare to speak!
You’re rational! In Helios you don’t believe,
Nor in the Thunderer or the Sea-God;
Dead is our Earth, so what fool would thank her? —

Take comfort, gods! For yet you adorn their verse
Though now the soul’s gone out of your pilfered names;
And if some high-flown word is needed,
You, Mother Nature, they still remember.
