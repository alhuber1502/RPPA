Epistle to J. Lapraik, An Old Scotch Bard

While briers an’ woodbines budding green,
 An’ paitricks scraichen loud at e’en,
 An’ morning poossie whiddan seen,
 Inspire my muse,
 This freedom, in an unknown frien’,
 I pray excuse. 

On Fasteneen we had a rockin’,
 To ca’ the crack, and weave our stockin’,
 And there was muckle fun and jokin’
 Ye need na doubt;
 At length we had a hearty yokin’
 At sang-about! 

There was ae sang, amang the rest
 (Aboon them a’ it pleased me best)
 That some kind husband had addrest
 To some sweet wife:
 It thirled the heart-strings through the breast,
 A’ to the life. 

I’ve scarce heard ought described sae weel
 What generous manly bosoms feel –
 Thought I, ‘Can this be Pope, or Steele,
 Or Beattie’s wark?’ 
They tald me ’twas an odd kind chiel
 About Muirkirk! 

It pat me fidgean-fain to hear’t,
 An’ sae about him there I spier’t;
 Then a’ that kent him round declare’t
 He had an ingine –
 That nane excelled it, few cam near’t,
 It was sae fine –

That (set him to a pint of ale,
 An’ either douse or merry tale,
 Or rhymes an’ sangs he’d made himsel’,
 Or witty catches),
 Tween Inverness and Tiviotdale
 He had few matches! 

Then up I gat, an’ swoor an aith:
 Though I should pawn my pleugh an’ graith,
 Or die a cadger-pownie’s death,
 At some dyke-back,
 A pint an’ gill I’d gie them baith,
 To hear your crack. 

But first an’ foremost, I should tell:
 Amaist as soon as I could spell,
 I to the crambo-jingle fell –
 Though rude an’ rough,
 Yet crooning to a body’s sel,
 Does weel eneugh. 

I am nae poet, in a sense,
 But just a rhymer like by chance,
 An’ hae to learning nae pretence –
 Yet, what the matter? 
Whene’er my Muse does on me glance,
 I jingle at her! 

Your critic-folk may cock their nose,
 And say, ‘How can you e’er propose
 (You wha ken hardly verse frae prose)
 To mak a sang?’ 
But by your leaves, my learned foes,
 Ye’re maybe wrang! 

What’s a’ your jargon o’ the schools,
 Your Latin names for horns an’ stools;
 If honest Nature made you fools,
 What sairs your grammars? 
Ye’d better taen up spades and shools,
 Or knappin-hammers. 

A set o’ dull, conceited hashes
 Confuse their brains in colledge-classes! 
They gang in stirks, and come out asses
 Plain truth to speak),
 An’ syne they think to climb Parnassus
 By dint o’ Greek! 

Gie me ae spark o’ Nature’s fire,
 That’s a’ the learning I desire;
 Then though I drudge through dub an’ mire
 At pleugh or cart,
 My Muse, though hamely in attire,
 May touch the heart …
