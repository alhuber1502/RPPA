For the Courtesan Ch’ing Lin

On your slender body
 Your jade and coral girdle ornaments chime
 Like those of a celestial companion
 Come from the Green Jade City of Heaven. 
One smile from you when we meet,
 And I become speechless and forget every word. 
For too long you have gathered flowers,
 And leaned against the bamboos,
 Your green sleeves growing cold,
 In your deserted valley:
 I can visualize you all alone,
 A girl harboring her cryptic thoughts.

You glow like a perfumed lamp
 In the gathering shadows. 
We play wine games
 And recite each other’s poems. 
Then you sing “Remembering South of the River”
 With its heart breaking verses. Then
 We paint each other’s beautiful eyebrows. 
I want to possess you completely —
 Your jade body
 And your promised heart. 
It is Spring. 
Vast mists cover the Five Lakes. 
My dear, let me buy a red painted boat
 And carry you away.
