Fantoches

Scaramoughe waves a threatening hand
   To Pulcinella, and they stand,
 Two shadows, black against the moon. 

The old doctor of Bologna pries   
For simples with impassive eyes,
 And mutters o’er a magic rune. 

The while his daughter, scarce half-dressed,
   Glides slyly ’neath the trees, in quest   
Of her bold pirate lover’s sail;

Her pirate from the Spanish main,
 Whose passion thrills her in the pain   
Of the loud languorous nightingale.
