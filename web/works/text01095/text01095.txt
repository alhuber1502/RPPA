To an Aeolian Harp

Leaning against the ivy wall
Of this old tenace,
You, secret-filled instrument
Of a muse born in the air,
Begin,
Begin again
Your melodious lament!

You come here, winds, from far away,
Ah! from the newly greening mound
Of the boy
Who was so dear to me. M
And brushing spring blossoms as you go,
Saturated with fragrant scents,
How sweetly you torment this heart.
And you rustle here in the strings
Drawn out with musical melancholy,
Growing in the course of my yearning,
And dying away again.

But all at once,
As the wind gusts more briskly,
A lovely cry of the harp
Repeats, to my sweet alarm,
The sudden impulse of my soul;
And here â€” the full-blown rose, shaken,
Scatters all its petals at my feet!
