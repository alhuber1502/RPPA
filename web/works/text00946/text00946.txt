Sonnet

Imitated from Wordsworth

Do not laugh at sonnets, mocking critic!
With them great Shakespeare turned his love to art;
Upon this graceful lute would Petrarch sigh,
And Tasso in his chains would ease his heart.

Camoens abridged his exile’s length of years
By singing sonnets for his love’s renown;
Dante loved and breathed this myrtle flower,
And wove it with the cypress for his crown.

Spenser, dreaming of his faerie realm,
Expressed in sonnets all his cherished griefs;
Those Milton sang restored its great regard.

I would revive the sonnet here in France;
From Florence, Du Bellay first brought it here,
And we know a few from our old Ronsard.
