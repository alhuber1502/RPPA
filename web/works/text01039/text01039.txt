The Lark

Here I cannot sing,
Out of this wall’s dark ring
I must mount
From happiness and deep despair.
O joy, in the brilliant height
To plunge and to soar!
In a song
To float above the green earth,
Below me changing streaks of Light and dark
While in flight I glide along,
Out of the depth come clamor and hammer and roar.
With earth shimmering in spring’s early light,
The world is full of sound: listen!
Heart, what makes you full of care?
You must surge up in the air!
As the sun steps forth,
How my breast and wings glisten,
How still and distant overhead is heaven’s door!
