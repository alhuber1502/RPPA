A Fancy

There is a tune for which I’d offer all
Of Mozart, all of Weber, all Rossini,
An old old tune with a darkly dying fall
And a magic it conceals except from me.

For suddenly, when I hear it played by someone,
My heart grows younger by two hundred years:
It’s Louis Treize’s reign, and there appears
A green slope yellowed by the evening sun;

A castle made of brick, the corners stone,
With stained-glass windows — there’s a reddish gleam
Surrounded by great parks, and with a stream
Washing its feet, with flowers all overgrown;

And a lady, at a casement in a tower,
Fair with dark eyes, in her old-fashioned dress,
Whom, in some other previous life, doubtless,
I’ve seen before — and I remember her!
