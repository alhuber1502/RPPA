My Saint

Welcome, spirit borne on wings of rapture
 From thy sacred dwelling-place above! 
Never on life’s road could I recapture
 Joys like those we shared in youthful love. 
Never knew my heart a pang as bitter
 As the agony of thy distress,
 O my saint, and never music sweeter
 Than thy name in grief or happiness. 

Thou art with me in thy hallowed semblance,
 Bringing to my thoughts a glad release;
 And my mourning, softened by remembrance,
 Is a pathway to the realms of peace. 
Sorrow slept not, but in desolation
 Wandered through the wilderness of pain,
 Till at last by love’s transfiguration
 Lo! I have thee, dearest, once again. 

From the silent lands thou’rt wafted now, love,
 And a glory shines in sorrow’s night
 From the radiance of thy perfect brow, love,
 And thine eyes, that stream with purest light. 
And I feel thy holy influence welling
 Round my dreams as once in days of yore,
 And again I hear thy promise, telling
 That we never shall be parted more.
