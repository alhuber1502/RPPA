Mandoline

The singers of serenades
   Whisper their faded vows
   Unto fair listening maids   
Under the singing boughs. 

Tircis, Aminte, are there,
 Clitandre has waited long,
 And Damis for many a fair   
Tyrant makes many a song. 

Their short vests, silken and bright,
 Their long pale silken trains,
 Their elegance of delight,
 Twine soft blue silken chains. 

And the mandolines and they,
 Faintlier breathing, swoon   
Into the rose and gray   
Ecstasy of the moon.
