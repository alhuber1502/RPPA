I have Closed the Double Doors ...

I have closed the double doors. 
In what corner of the heavens is she? 
A horizontal flute
 Beyond the red walls
 Blown as gently as the breeze
 Blows the willow floss. 
In the lingering glow of the sunset
 The roosting crows ignore my melancholy. 
Once again I languidly get out of bed. 
After I have burned incense,
 I loiter on the jeweled staircase. 
I regret the wasted years,
 Sick, afraid of the cold, afraid of the heat,
 While the beautiful days went by. 
Suddenly it is the Autumn Feast of the Dead. 
Constantly disturbed by the changing weather,
 I lose track of the flowing light
 That washes us away. 
Who moved the turning bridges
 On my inlaid psaltery? 
I realize â€”
 Of the twenty five strings
 Twenty one are gone.
