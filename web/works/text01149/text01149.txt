The poet goes away into the fields ...

The poet goes away into the fields. He admires,
He adores, he listens to his inner lyres,
And seeing him arrive, the flowers, all of them,
Those whose colours would make the brightest rubies dim,
Those whose petals outshine even a peacock’s tail,
The little gold flowers and the blue ones, the pale
(As each of them greets him by shaking its bouquet)
Take on submissive or coquettish airs, and say
Familiarly, for that manner suits beauties well:
“Oh look! our little lover is passing this way!”
And then the shadow-filled and glowing trees that dwell
In the woods, resounding with the voices they let loose,
All of those ancient men, the maples and the yews,
The lindens, wrinkled willows, oaks hallowed by the years,
The black-branched elms overburdened with moss —
Like ulemas when the mufti appears
Greet him with grand gestures, and slowly bow down
Their large leafy heads and ivy beards to the ground,
Then contemplate his forehead shining in the sun,
And murmur quietly: “It’s him, the dreamy one!”
