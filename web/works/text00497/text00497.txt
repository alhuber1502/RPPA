The Army of Truth

Words, the world so light esteemeth? 
Lower yet,
 words in poet’s stanza set! 
O how frail your power seemeth,
 to be fighting
 for the truth mankind is slighting. 

Truth should come with thunder pealing,
 flashing Levin:
 To her succour sent from Heaven,
 angel hosts their cohorts wheeling,
 wide extended,
 should escort her advent splendid. 

Ah! Why comes she not, th’exalted,
 hither now? 
With a helm about her brow,
 fashioned of the sky star-vaulted,
 fiercer looming,
 swords her radiant pinions pluming? 

Why are not her white tents planted,
 far and wide,
 gleaming on the mountain side?
 why are not her warriors granted,
 in their striving,
 mastery over life and living? 

Bastioned night is steep for storming;
 bigotry
 rests secure on columns high;
 like Egyptian serpents swarming,
 round her temple,
 error’s black-robed guards assemble. 

Onward yet, brave words, undaunted,
 howso few! 
Earthly triumph has to you
 by the God of light been granted,
 who are serving
 truth, his child, with faith unswerving. 

Forward, words, the truth’s selected
 Hero band! 
Soon in human hearts shall stand
 your victorious tents erected;
 glory sweeping
 sunlit folds above your sleeping. 

Forward, then, with fearless faces,
 truth’s firm line! 
Yours shall be, by pledge divine,
 power no earthly might displaces;
 death can never
 still thee, voice of truth, for ever. 

Cease then, puny host, your quailing,
 truth her cause
 through defeat to triumph draws:
 Falsehood’s desert heights assailing,
 see, your powers
 dissipate those phantom towers!
