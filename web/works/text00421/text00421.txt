The Song Of Exile

My homeland has many palm-trees
 and the thrush-song fills its air;
 no bird here can sing as well
 as the birds sing over there. 

We have fields more full of flowers
 and a starrier sky above,
 we have woods more full of life
 and a life more full of love. 

Lonely night-time meditations
 please me more when I am there;
 my homeland has many palm-trees
 and the thrush-song fills its air. 

Such delights as my land offers
 Are not found here nor elsewhere;
 lonely night-time meditations
 please me more when I am there;
 My homeland has many palm-trees
 and the thrush-song fills its air. 

Don't allow me, God, to die
 without getting back to where
 I belong, without enjoying
 the delights found only there,
 without seeing all those palm-trees,
 hearing thrush-songs fill the air.
