The Song of the Wolves

Loud the storm is howling
under a thundery sky.
The twin sons of winter,
snow and rain, sleet by.

It’s a barren plain-land
we choose for abiding.
Not a bush grows there
for shelter or hiding.

Hunger gnaws the belly,
cold gnaws the bone,
two tormenters who will not
leave us alone —

and there, the third tormenter,
guns loaded with lead:
on the white, white snow
our blood drips red.

Freezing and starving
and peppered with shot —
yes, our lot is misery ...
But Freedom is our lot!
