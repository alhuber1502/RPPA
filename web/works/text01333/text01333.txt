Bakhchisaray by Night

Now all have scattered from the mosque. The cry
To prayers into the evening fades away
And ruby tinges the pale cheeks of day.
The king of night is hastening home to lie

Beside his love. The harem of the sky
Glows soft with stars, eternal lamps that play
Upon a cloud that swanlike on the bay
Of heaven sleeps, bright-stained with sunset dye.

Here shadows fall from minarets, and dark
A cypress stands; the granite circling walls
Like demons in the hall of Eblis hide

Beneath the canopy of night ... And hark!
The lightning wakes! Like mounted knights it falls
And through the silent wastes the flashes ride.
