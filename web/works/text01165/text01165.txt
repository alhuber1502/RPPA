Thought from Byron

I thought my love and constancy
Had made you play less stem a part,
And so the breath of foolish hope
Penetrated to my heart.
But time has shown the truth to me —
Time which I prolong in vain —
And like a dream my hope has fled ...
I feel my love alone remain.

My love remains like an abyss
Between my life and happiness,
I feel a victim of some wrong,
Feel on my heart great heaviness!
In my all-consuming grief
I see my youthful days depart ..
If there’s a sparkle in my eye
It’s a tear about to start.
