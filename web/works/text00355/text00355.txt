Sonnet on Reading ‘The Mountain Daisy’ by Burns

While soon the ‘garden’s flaunting flowers’ decay
 And (scattered on the earth) neglected lie,
 The mountain daisy, cherished by the ray
 A poet drew from Heaven, shall never die. 
Ah, like that lovely flower the Poet rose
 Mid Penury’s bare soil and bitter gale! 
He felt each storm that on the mountain blows,
 Nor ever knew the shelter of the vale. 
By Genius in her native vigour nursed,
 On Nature with impassioned look he gazed,
 Then through the cloud of adverse fortune burst
 Indignant, and in light unborrowed blazed! 
Scotia, from rude affliction shield thy bard –
 His Heaven-taught numbers, Fate herself will guard.
