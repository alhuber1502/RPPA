Chopin’s piano

1

Bound to your place those penultimate days
 Whose plot was impenetrable —
 — Myth-full,
 Dawn-pallid ...
 — Life’s end a whisper summons its start:
 “I will not render you — no! I will raise you! ...” 

2

Bound to your place, those days so penultimate
 Once when you mirrored — each moment, each moment —
 That lyre that Orpheus lent us,
 Whose force like a missile struggles with song,
 And its four strings commune with
 Each, striking each other,
 By twos — and by twos —
 A murmur slipping toward silence:
 “Did he begin
 To pound out a note? ... 
Of what sound was he Maestro! whose playing’s repelling? ...” 

3

Bound to your place in those days, oh Frederic! 
You with your hand alabastered
 In whiteness — possessing — and shuffling —
 Your touch scarce a touch — ostrich feather like —
 Brushing me blurred in my eyes with your ivory
 Keyboard ... 
And you like that figure
 From marble’s own womb
 As if hammered
 Would pull back your chisel
 Your genius — eternal Pygmalion! 

4

What in that, in what you have played, and then what? —
 A first note recited — and what? he’ll express it
 However its echoes set themselves up, will be different
 From when with your own hand you blessed
 Every chord —
 And played it through, simple
 And perfect like Pericles,
 Like a virtue drawn from a deep past,
 Set foot in a village, a log cabin home,
 Told herself as she entered:
 I was reborn in heaven,
 Whose gate changed into my harp,
 A ribbon — a path ... 
Where the Host — I could spy through pale wheatblades —
 Emanuel he who now dwells
 On Mount Tabor! 

5

And Poland within, from that zenith
 Perfections of history, ancient, arrayed
 Rainbow’s ravishment — Poland —
 Wheelwrights transformed! 
Selfsame, certain,
 Gold bee! 

6

And — now — you’ve ended the song — And I
 No longer can see you — only — can hear
 Hearing what? — like when boys baffle boys —
 — The keys still resisting
 The source of their yearnings unsung
 They softly push back on their own
 By eighths — then by fifths —
 And murmuring: “He — has he started to play? 
Or uncaring — cast us aside?” 

7

Oh You! Love’s profile
 Fulfillment your name:
 These — Art dubs them style,
 Who penetrate song, who shape stones ... 
Oh! You — who in chronicles sign yourself Era,
 Where you are, aren’t, history’s Zenith,
 Are Spirit and Letter in one,
 “Consumatum Est” ... 
You! Oh — Exquisite fulfillment,
 Whichever you are, And where? ... Are a sign ... 
In Phidias? David? Or Chopin? 
Or a scene out of Aeschylus? ... 
Evermore — vengeance upon you: PRIVATION! ... 
Globe’s Stigma — penury:
 How it hurts him! ... Fulfillment? ... 
He — who prefers to begin
 Forever to throw out before him — down payed!
 — “Ear of Corn”? ... like a gold comet ripened,
 Wind’s breath barely stirs it,
 A rain of wheat sprinkles down grains
 Perfection alone sweeps away ...

Over here — Frederic, look! ... This is — Warsaw:
 Under a star blazing forth
 A crazed brightness —
 — Attend to it, organs in parish halls; look! it’s Your nest:
 It’s elsewhere — old houses patrician
 As commonwealths,
 Pavements of squares deaf and grey,
 And Sigismund’s sword in a cloud. 

9

Look! ... from alley to alley
 Caucasian horses break forth
 Like swallows ahead of a storm,
 Ahead of their regiments, darting,
 By hundreds — by hundreds —
 — The town house caught fire, died down,
 Then flared up again — And there — Under the wall
 Saw the foreheads of widows in mourning
 Pushed back by rifle butts —
 And again, smokeblinded, I saw,
 As it moved past the portal, the pillars,
 A contraption that looked like a coffin
 They were heaving out ... crashing and crushing — your piano! 

10

That one! ... that championed Poland, he from the heights
 All-Perfections of history
 People-bound, anthem ecstatic —
 O Poland — of wheelwrights transformed;
 That same one — crushed on the granite squares!
 — Over there: as the thoughts of the just man
 Are drowned in the popular anger
 Or as, from age unto age,
 All its angers awaken! 
And right there — like Orpheus’ body,
 A thousand nailed passions tear him to shreds
 And each one howling: “Not me! ... 
Not me!” — with a clatter and chatter of teeth — —
 Is it you? — is it me? — then let’s strike up a Judgment Day song,
 Urge them on: “Rejoice, o you child who will be! ... 
With groaning — stories gone deaf:
 The Ideal — now brought low on the pavement” — —
