Written During the Author’s Imprisonment, November 1814

Winter has reached thee once again at last,
 And now the rambler, whom thy groves yet please,
 Feels on his house-warm lips the thin air freeze,
 While in his shrugging neck the resolute blast
 Comes edging; and the leaves, in heaps down cast,
 He shuffles with his hastening foot, and sees
 The cold sky whitening through the wiry trees,
 And sighs to think his loitering noons have passed. 

And do I love thee less, to paint thee so? 
No. This the season is of beauty still,
 Doubled at heart; of smoke, with whirling glee
 Uptumbling ever from the blaze below,
 And home remembered most – and oh, loved hill,
 The second, and the last, away from thee!
