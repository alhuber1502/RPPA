Peter Bell the Third

[Part IV, ll. 1-65]

Sin

Lo, Peter in Hell’s Grosvenor Square,
 A footman in the Devil’s service! 
And the misjudging world would swear
 That every man in service there
 To virtue would prefer vice. 

But Peter, though now damned, was not
 What Peter was before damnation:
 Men oftentimes prepare a lot
 Which, ere it finds them, is not what
 Suits with their genuine station. 

All things that Peter saw and felt
 Had a peculiar aspect to him;
 And when they came within the belt
 Of his own nature, seemed to melt,
 Like cloud to cloud, into him. 

And so the outward world uniting
 To that within him, he became
 Considerably uninviting
 To those who, meditation slighting,
 Were moulded in a different frame. 

And he scorned them, and they scorned him! 
And he scorned all they did – and they
 Did all that men of their own trim
 Are wont to do to please their whim,
 Drinking, lying, swearing, play. 

Such were his fellow-servants – thus
 His virtue, like our own, was built
 Too much on that indignant fuss
 Hypocrite pride stirs up in us
 To bully one another’s guilt. 

He had a mind which was somehow
 At once circumference and centre
 Of all he might or feel or know –
 Nothing went ever out, although
 Something did ever enter. 

He had as much imagination
 As a pint-pot – he never could
 Fancy another situation,
 From which to dart his contemplation,
 Than that wherein he stood! 

Yet his was individual mind,
 And new created all he saw
 In a new manner, and refined
 Those new creations, and combined
 Them, by a master-spirit’s law. 

Thus, though unimaginative,
 An apprehension clear, intense,
 Of his mind’s work, had made alive
 The things it wrought on – I believe
 Wakening a sort of thought in sense. 

But from the first ’twas Peter’s drift
 To be a kind of moral eunuch,
 He touched the hem of Nature’s shift,
 Felt faint – and never dared uplift
 The closest, all-concealing tunic! 

She laughed the while, with an arch smile,
 And kissed him with a sister’s kiss,
 And said: ‘My best Diogenes,
 I love you well, but, if you please,
 Tempt not again my deepest bliss! 

’Tis you are cold – for I, not coy,
 Yield love for love, frank, warm, and true;
 And Burns, a Scottish peasant-boy –
 His errors prove it – knew my joy
 More, learned friend, than you.
