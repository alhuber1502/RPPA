Here, in so poor a tomb ...

Here, in so poor a tomb, are still the bones
of the sublime, one epic poet found,
who made the ancient trumpet highly sound
from pole to distant pole in modem tones?

And Rome, ah, Rome no worthy tombstone owns
for one whose flight made every sky rebound!
Is, then, her major shrine a dusty mound
of bishop-kings, a catacomb of moans?

Throng of dead men who never were alive,
depart at once, and let this Vatican,
cleansed of your stench, still rise and still survive!

There, at the center, let this man be placed,
where, worthy of them both, now soars the dome
which for great Tasso Buonarroti raised.
