On Esthwaite Water

O’er Esthwaite’s lake, serene and still,
 At sunset’s silent peaceful hour
 Scarce moved the zephyr’s softest breath,
 Or sighed along its reedy shore. 

The lovely landscape on its sides,
 With evening’s softening hues impressed,
 Shared in the general calm, and gave
 Sweet visions of repose and rest. 

Inverted on the waveless flood,
 A spotless mirror smooth and clear,
 Each fair surrounding object shone
 In softer beauty imaged there. 

Brown hills and woods of various shades,
 Orchards and sloping meadows green,
 Sweet rural seats and sheltered farms,
 Were in the bright reflector seen. 

E’en lofty Tilberthwaite from far
 His giant shadow boldly threw,
 His ruggéd, dark, high-towering head
 On Esthwaite’s tranquil breast to view. 

Struck with the beauty of the scene,
 I cried, ‘Oh may my yielding breast
 Retain but images of peace
 Like those, sweet lake, on thine impressed! 

Ne’er may it feel a ruder gale
 Than that which o’er thy surface spreads,
 When sportive zephyrs briskly play,
 And whisper through thy bordering reeds –

When, dancing in the solar beam,
 Thy silvery waves the margin seek
 With gently undulating flow,
 And there in softest murmurs break.’ 

Vain wish – o’er Esthwaite’s tranquil lake
 A stronger gale full frequent blows,
 The soothing prospect disappears,
 The lovely visions of repose!
