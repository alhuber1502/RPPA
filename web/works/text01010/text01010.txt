Animal and Plant

Only a short while, Heaven and Earth, will the springtime linger:
This is your wedding time; brief is the touch of the light.
You that have sprung from the earth, Plant, why do you strive so upward,
Pushing your tendrils and blooms? Plant, it is known to you why.

Only the sex drive links you to light’s realm, ties you to sunshine.
Animals do things otherwise, otherwise is it with men:
Born of the sun, they are rooted in earth through the sex drive only,
While through sex they enchant heaven to descend to the earth.

Procreativity all throughout nature comes: from the male sex.
Nature to you, gentle sex, granted the tending of plants,
Sprouting the sun’s offspring by the culturing of what is in them;
These shoots man had with love grafted on glorious ground.

She also gave plant-nature to woman, and plant I shall call her:
Plant among animals she, beast among animals he.
Gentler is feminine love, more vital, calmer, and briefer;
Man loves more like a beast, free, but his love will endure.
