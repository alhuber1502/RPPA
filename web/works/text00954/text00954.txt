Sonnet

To see you every day, love only you,
No ruse, no guile, no shame, nor lies or worse,
Not cheated by desire, gnawed by remorse,
Giving our hearts each moment, just we two.

Honor our thoughts, as deep as any sea:
Show the sun our love, not reverie,
And in this clarity breathe free and long,
As Laura breathed, and heard her lover's song.

You whose every step is heavenly,
It's you we all believe, rosy and gay,
We have to love like this, you always say.

And I, old child of doubt and blasphemy,
I listen, think, and answer you this way:
Not life, but yes, this is how love should be.
