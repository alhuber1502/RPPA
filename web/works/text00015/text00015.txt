Oh! Blame Not the Bard

Oh! blame not the bard, if he fly to the bowers
 Where Pleasure lies carelessly smiling at Fame;
 He was born for much more, and in happier hours
 His soul might have burned with a holier flame. 
The string that now languishes loose o’er the lyre
 Might have bent a proud bow to the warrior’s dart,
 And the lip which now breathes but the song of desire
 Might have poured the full tide of a patriot’s heart. 

But alas for his country! Her pride is gone by,
 And that spirit is broken which never would bend;
 O’er the ruin her children in secret must sigh,
 For ’tis treason to love her, and death to defend! 
Unprized are her sons, till they’ve learned to betray;
 Undistinguished they live, if they shame not their sires;
 And the torch that would light them through dignity’s way
 Must be caught from the pile where their country expires. 

Then blame not the bard, if in passion’s soft dream
 He should try to forget what he never can heal:
 Oh, give but a hope – let a vista but gleam
 Through the gloom of his country – and mark how he’ll feel! 
That instant his heart at her shrine would lay down
 Every passion it nursed, every bliss it adored;
 While the myrtle, now idly entwined with his crown,
 Like the wreath of Harmodius, should cover his sword. 

But though glory be gone, and though hope fade away,
 Thy name, loved Erin, shall live in his songs:
 Not e’en in the hour when his heart is most gay
 Will he lose the remembrance of thee and thy wrongs! 
The stranger shall hear thy lament on his plains;
 The sigh of thy harp shall be sent o’er the deep –
 Till thy masters themselves, as they rivet thy chains,
 Shall pause at the song of thy captive and weep.
