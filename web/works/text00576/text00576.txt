The Calm after the Storm

The storm has passed
 I hear the birds singing and the hen
 Returning to the street
 Repeating her refrain. See the serene sky
 Breaks through from the west, at the mountain,
 Liberating the countryside
 And the river appears clearly in the valley. 
Every heart rejoices, from everywhere
 Noise rises again and
 Usual work resumes. 
The artisan looking at the humid sky
 With work in hand, singing,
 He comes to the door. 
The young woman comes out
 Looking for water from the fresh rainfall;
 And the vegetable seller resumes
 From street to street
 His daily cry. 
Here the Sun returns, here smiling
 Amongst the hills and villas. 
Families open balconies, terraces
 And loggias. And from the main roads the far off
 Clinking of bell-harnesses can be heard; The carriage creaks
 From the traveler who resumes his journey. 

Every heart rejoices
 When life, so sweet so enjoyed,
 Is like this? 
When with much love
 Man approaches his studies? 
Or resumes his work? Or learns new things? 
When not even his ills are remembered? 
Pleasure, son of suffering,
 Vain joy, fruit
 Of previous fear
 When death shook and scared
 He who abhorred life
 When in long torment,
 Cold, silent, pale
 People sweated and shook, seeing
 Moved by our offences
 Lightening, clouds and wind. 
O gentle nature
 These are your gifts
 These are the joys
 You offer to mortals. To escape from pain
 Is a joy for us. 
You liberally spread travails, suffering appears
 Spontaneously and, that little pleasure, which
 Strangely and at times miraculously grows
 From toil, is a great gain. Human kind
 Dear to the gods! You are happy
 If you are allowed breathing space
 From pain: blessed are you
 If death restores you from all pain.
