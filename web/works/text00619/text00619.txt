Miner

Rock-face, burst and boom and ring
 to my heavy hammering! 
Downwards must I burrow, pounding
 till I hear the metals sounding. 

Deep in mountain’s night obscure
 treasures beckon and allure,
 diamond and stones past pricing,
 veins of gold, red-branched, enticing. 

In the depth, too, there is peace, –
 peace eternal, wilderness; –
 break my way, you hammer, batter
 to the secret heart of matter. 

Once, a boy, I’d sit and play
 under heaven’s starred array;
 tread the springtime’s path of flowers,
 tranquil in those childhood hours. 

I forgot day’s splendid light
 in the pit’s dense gloom of night,
 hill-side too, its sighs and singing,
 in my lode’s harsh temple – ringing. 

When at first I made descent,
 all my thought was innocent:
 ‘Earth’s deep spirits will unravel
 life’s great maze that I must travel’. 

But no spirit solved for me
 puzzle or complexity;
 and no sun has risen shining
 from this darkened realm of mining. 

A mistake then? Can this be
 no new path to clarity? 
For the brightness blinds my sight
 if I seek that in the light. 

No, still delve I must, not cease;
 here lives my eternal peace. 
Break my way, you hammer, batter
 to the secret heart of matter. 

Hammering and hammering
 to the last day life shall bring. 
Never beam of brightness dawning,
 never sun-of-hope’s full morning.
