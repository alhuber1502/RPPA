A Dream

In the midday heat in a valley of Daghestan
Unmoving I lay, a bullet in my chest;
Steam was still rising from the deep wound,
And drop by drop the blood was seeping out.

I lay alone on the valleyâ€™s sandy floor,
Hemmed in by jutting cliffs on every side;
And the sun was scorching their yellow pinnacles
And scorching me, but I slept like the dead.

And in a dream I saw the brilliant glow
Of a gala evening in my native land.
Young women with festive garlands in their hair
Were talking about me in a merry band.

But there was one who sat in silent thought
And took no part in all the merry talk,
And her young soul was plunged in a sad dream,
Distracted from the feast by god knows what;

And in a dream in a valley of Daghestan
She saw a familiar corpse stretched on the sand;
The steaming wound grew darker in his chest,
And the flowing stream of blood was growing cold.
