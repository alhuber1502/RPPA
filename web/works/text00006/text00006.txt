Lucy Gray

Oft had I heard of Lucy Gray,
 And when I crossed the wild
 I chanced to see at break of day
 The solitary child. 

No mate, no comrade, Lucy knew:
 She dwelt on a wild moor,
 The sweetest thing that ever grew
 Beside a human door! 

Yet you may spy the fawn at play,
 The hare upon the green,
 But the sweet face of Lucy Gray
 Will never more be seen. 

‘Tonight will be a stormy night,
 You to the town must go,
 And take a lantern, child, to light
 Your mother through the snow.’ 

‘That, father, will I gladly do,
 ’Tis scarcely afternoon! 
The minster-clock has just struck two,
 And yonder is the moon.’ 

At this the father raised his hook
 And snapped a faggot-band;
 He plied his work, and Lucy took
 The lantern in her hand. 

Not blither is the mountain-roe:
 With many a wanton stroke
 Her feet disperse the powdery snow
 That rises up like smoke. 

The storm came on before its time;
 She wandered up and down,
 And many a hill did Lucy climb
 But never reached the town. 

The wretched parents all that night
 Went shouting far and wide,
 But there was neither sound nor sight
 To serve them for a guide. 

At daybreak on a hill they stood
 That overlooked the moor,
 And thence they saw the bridge of wood
 A furlong from their door. 

And now they homeward turned, and cried,
 ‘In Heaven we all shall meet’ –
 When in the snow the mother spied
 The print of Lucy’s feet. 

Then downward from the steep hill’s edge
 They tracked the footmarks small,
 And through the broken hawthorn-hedge,
 And by the long stone wall. 

And then an open field they crossed –
 The marks were still the same –
 They tracked them on, nor ever lost,
 And to the bridge they came. 

They followed from the snowy bank
 The footmarks one by one,
 Into the middle of the plank,
 And further there were none. 

Yet some maintain that to this day
 She is a living child,
 That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
 Upon the lonesome wild. 

O’er rough and smooth she trips along
 And never looks behind,
 And sings a solitary song
 That whistles in the wind.
