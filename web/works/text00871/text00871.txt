Half of Life

With yellow pears leans
And filled with wild roses
The land into the sea,
You lovely swans,
And drunk with kisses
You dunk your heads
Into the sacred-sober water.

Alas, where do I get, when
It is winter, flowers, and where
Sunshine
And shadows of earth?
The walls stand
Speechless and cold, in the wind
The weathervanes clatter.
