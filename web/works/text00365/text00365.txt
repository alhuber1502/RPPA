The Prelude

[‘A Dedicated Spirit’, Book IV., ll. 316-345]

In a throng,
 A festal company of maids and youths,
 Old men and matrons staid – promiscuous rout,
 A medley of all tempers – I had passed
 The night in dancing, gaiety, and mirth,
 With din of instruments and shuffling feet
 And glancing forms and tapers glittering
 And unaimed prattle flying up and down,
 Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there
 Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed
 That mounted up like joy into the head
 And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired
 The cock had crowed, the sky was bright with day;
 Two miles I had to walk along the fields
 Before I reached my home. Magnificent
 The morning was, a memorable pomp,
 More glorious than I ever had beheld. 
The sea was laughing at a distance; all
 The solid mountains were as bright as clouds,
 Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light;
 And in the meadows and the lower grounds
 Was all the sweetness of a common dawn –
 Dews, vapours, and the melody of birds,
 And labourers going forth into the fields. 
Ah, need I say, dear friend, that to the brim
 My heart was full? I made no vows, but vows
 Were then made for me: bond unknown to me
 Was given that I should be, else sinning greatly,
 A dedicated spirit. On I walked
 In blessedness, which even yet remains.
