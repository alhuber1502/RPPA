A Poet’s Welcome to his Love-begotten Daughter

Thou’s welcome, wean! Mishanter fa’ me
 If thoughts o’ thee, or yet thy Mamie,
 Shall ever daunton me or awe me,
 My bonnie lady,
 Or if I blush when thou shalt ca’ me
 Tyta, or Daddie! 

Tho’ now they ca’ me fornicator,
 And tease my name in kintra clatter,
 The mair they talk, I’m kend the better;
 E’en let them clash! 
An auld wife’s tongue’s a feckless matter
 To gie ane fash! 

Welcome, my bonnie, sweet, wee dochter! 
Tho’ ye come here a wee unsought for,
 And tho’ your comin I hae fought for,
 Baith Kirk and Queir,
 Yet by my faith, ye’re no unwrought for,
 That I shall swear! 

Wee image o’ my bonnie Betty,
 As fatherly I kiss and daut thee,
 As dear and near my heart I set thee,
 Wi’ as gude will
 As a’ the priests had seen me get thee
 That’s out o’ Hell! 

Sweet fruit o’ monie a merry dint,
 My funny toil is no a’ tint;
 Tho’ ye come to the warld askent,
 Which fools may scoff at,
 In my last plack your part’s be in’t,
 The better half o’t! 

Tho’ I should be the waur bestead,
 Thou’s be as braw and bienly clad,
 And thy young years as nicely bred
 Wi’ education,
 As ony brat o’ wedlock’s bed,
 In a’ thy station –

For if thou be, what I wad hae thee,
 And tak the counsel I shall gie thee,
 I’ll never rue my trouble wi’ thee,
 The cost nor shame o’t,
 But be a loving Father to thee,
 And brag the name o’t!
