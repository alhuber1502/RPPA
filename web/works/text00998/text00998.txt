The Poet

What is it all our senses wish and strive for?
They want to soar again into the Universe.
What is the highest end of all our striving?
Man, once transfigured, wants to quit this earth.

So if, O blessed gods, you want his thanks
Who is devoted to the highest service,
Who but in holy nature lives his life,
Then in light vapor let him quickly vanish.

The soul is happy floating on sweet sound,
And listens, musing what it might portend
If ever divinity should grant her wish;

She wants to grow so beautiful in song
Her body will kindle in the play of flame
And she be soon transfigured to a gentle breath.
