Thuiskon

As now the sunbeams flee before the twilight, and the evening star
Its softer light, its cloudless, fresh, and quickening shimmer,
Lowers down now to the grove of the bards
And in the grove the fountain sings it a melody;

So descends the apparition of Thuiskon from the heavens
Like silver mist from falling water, and he comes to you,
Poets, and the fountain. The oak rustles
In whispers to him. So sang the Venusian Swan,

When it flew away transformed. And Thuiskon hears it, and hovers
In the rustling sounds of the welcoming grove, and he listens;
But with loud greetings now he is received
With string and song, by his descendants all around him.

Melodies resound for him, like those of Telyn in Valhalla,
Of the varying, bolder, and more German flight of an ode,
Which like the eagle now mounts to the clouds,
And then drops down to the top branches of the oak.
