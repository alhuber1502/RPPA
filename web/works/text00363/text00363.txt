Peter Bell

[Prologue, ll. 1-15, 31-80, 101-110, 121-155]

There’s something in a flying horse,
 There’s something in a huge balloon,
 But through the clouds I’ll never float
 Until I have a little boat
 In shape just like the crescent moon. 

And now I have a little boat
 In shape just like the crescent moon –
 Fast through the clouds my boat can sail,
 But if perchance your faith should fail,
 Look up, and you shall see me soon! 

The woods, my friends, are round you roaring,
 The woods are roaring like a sea;
 The noise of danger’s in your ears,
 And you have all a thousand fears
 Both for my little boat and me. 

Up goes my boat between the stars
 Through many a breathless field of light,
 Through many a long blue field of ether,
 Leaving ten thousand stars beneath her –
 Up goes my little boat so bright! 

The towns in Saturn are ill-built,
 But Jove has very pretty bowers;
 The evening star is not amiss –
 But what are all of them to this,
 This little earth of ours? 

Then back again to our green earth! 
What business had I here to roam? 
The world for my remarks and me
 Will not a whit the better be –
 I’ve left my heart at home. 

And that is then the dear green earth
 And that’s the dear Pacific Ocean
 And that is Caucasus so dear,
 To think that I again am here –
 Oh, my poor heart’s commotion! 

And there is little Tartary
 And there’s the famous River Dnieper,
 And there, amid the ocean green,
 Is that sweet isle, of isles the Queen –
 Ye fairies, from all evil keep her! 

And there’s the town where I was born,
 And that’s the house of Parson Swan. 
My heart is touched, I must avow
 (Consider where I’ve been!), and now
 I feel I am a man. 

Never did fifty things at once
 Appear so lovely, never never;
 The woods, how sweetly do they ring –
 To hear the earth’s sweet murmuring
 Thus could I hang for ever. 

‘Oh shame upon you, cruel shame! 
Was ever such a heartless loon
 In such a lovely boat to sit,
 And make no better use of it? –
 A boat that’s like the crescent moon! 

Out, out, and like a brooding hen
 Beside your sooty hearth-stone cower! 
Go creep along the dirt, and pick
 Your way with your good walking-stick,
 Just three good miles an hour. 

Sure in the breast of full-grown poet
 So faint a heart was ne’er before! 
Come to the poets’ wild delights –
 I have ten thousand lovely sights,
 Ten thousand sights in store.’ 

‘My pretty little form of light,
 My sweet and beautiful canoe,
 Now (though it grieves me to the heart)
 I feel, I feel that we must part –
 I must take leave of you. 

You are a pretty little barge,
 But while your pleasure you’re pursuing
 Without impediment or let,
 My little barge, you quite forget
 What in the world is doing. 

There is a party in the bower,
 Round the stone table in my garden:
 The squire is there, and, as I guess,
 His pretty little daughter Bess,
 With Harry the churchwarden. 

They were to come this very evening,
 They know not I have been so far;
 I see them there, in number nine,
 All in the bower of Weymouth pine,
 I see them, there they are. 

And there’s the wife of Parson Swan,
 And there’s my good friend Stephen Otter –
 And, ere the light of evening fail,
 To them I must relate the tale
 Of Peter Bell the Potter.’ 

Off flew my pretty little barge
 All in a trance of indignation,
 And I, as well as I was able,
 On two poor legs to my stone table
 Limped on with some vexation. 

‘Oh here he is!’ cried little Bess
 (She saw me at the garden-door),
 ‘Oh here he is!’ cried Mistress Swan –
 And all at once around me ran
 Full nine of them or more. 

‘Sit down, I beg you would be seated’,
 Said I – no doubt with visage pale –
 ‘And if, my friends, it pleases you,
 This instant, without more ado,
 We’ll have the promised tale.’ 

And so, though somewhat out of breath,
 With lips, no doubt, and visage pale,
 And sore too from a slight contusion,
 Did I, to cover my confusion,
 Begin the promised tale.
