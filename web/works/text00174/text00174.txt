The Witching Time

’Tis the ‘witching time of night’,
 Orbed is the moon and bright,
 And the stars, they glisten, glisten,
 Seeming with bright eyes to listen! 
For what listen they? 
For a song and for a charm –
 See they glisten in alarm,
 And the moon is waxing warm
 To hear what I shall say! 
Moon, keep wide thy golden ears! 
Hearken stars, and hearken spheres! 
Hearken thou eternal sky! 
I sing an infant’s lullaby,
 A pretty lullaby. 
Listen, listen, listen, listen,
 Glisten, glisten, glisten, glisten,
 And hear my lullaby! 
Though the rushes that will make
 Its cradle still are in the lake;
 Though the linen that will make
 Its swathe is on the cotton-tree;
 Though the woollen that will keep
 It warm is on the silly sheep;
 Listen stars-light, listen, listen,
 Glisten, glisten, glisten, glisten,
 And hear my lullaby. 
Child, I see thee! Child, I’ve found thee
 Midst of the quiet all around thee! 
Child, I see thee! Child, I spy thee! 
And thy mother sweet is nigh thee! 
Child, I know thee – child no more,
 But a poet evermore! 
See, see, the lyre, the lyre
 In a flame of fire,
 Upon the little cradle’s top
 Flaring, flaring, flaring,
 Past the eyesight’s bearing –
 Awake it from its sleep,
 And see if it can keep
 Its eyes upon the blaze. 
Amaze, amaze! 
It stares, it stares, it stares –
 It dares what no one dares! 
It lifts its little hand into the flame
 Unharmed, and on the strings
 Paddles a little tune, and sings
 With dumb endeavour, sweetly! 
Bard art thou completely,
 Little child
 O’ the western wild,
 Bard art thou completely:
 Sweetly, with dumb endeavour,
 A poet now or never! 
Little child
 O’ the western wild,
 A poet now or never!
