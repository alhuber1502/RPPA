Hyperion

Upon a time, as people said,
 In fairy-tales of old,
 There lived a high-born, royal maid
 Of grace and charms untold. 

She was her parents’ only child,
 In all beyond compare,
 As is ’mid saints the Virgin mild,
 The Moon ‘mid stars, so fair. 

She leaves the stately colonnade;
 Her steps will gain anon
 The window where, beyond the shade,
 Awaits Hyperion. 

She looked and saw how on the seas
 He rose and shone e’ermore,
 How the black-painted argosies
 On restless paths he bore. 

She sees him nightly, now, anew,
 Straight forward the desire;
 He, gazing for some fortnights, too,
 Grows brighter with new fire. 

And as she, dreamful, rests her head
 Upon her snow-white hands,
 To love for him her soul is wed,
 Her heart with love expands. 

And with what brightness does he speak
 And glitter every night,
 When in the castle’s shadows dark
 She comes into his sight. 

And step by step pursuing her,
 He glides into her room
 And weaves a glistening gossamer
 Upon her frozen loom. 

And when, to seek her nightly rest,
 Supine in bed she lies,
 He strokes her hands crossed on her breast
 And closes her sweet eyes. 

Upon her body mirrors cast
 A flood of golden light,
 Upon her eyes that beat so fast
 Beneath her lids closed tight. 

She smiled at him with sweet assent,
 He in the glass did thrill
 And in her dreams pursued her, bent
 On winning of her will. 

While sleeping deeply in her room,
 She heaves a heavy sigh:
 ‘O gentle sov’reign of my gloom,
 Will you not come? Draw nigh! 

Descend, O mild Hyperion,
 Glide down upon a ray,
 Into my home and thoughts anon
 And brighten up my way!’ 

The more he thrilled at such discourse,
 The brighter kindled he;
 He hurled himself with all his force
 And sank into the sea;

The water where he fell whirled round,
 In ripples and, forsooth,
 From the mysterious profound
 Up sprang a princely youth. 

A threshold is not easier spanned
 Than is the window’s edge;
 He has a truncheon in his hand
 And it is crowned with sedge. 

A very voievode, he was young,
 Had soft and golden hair,
 A knotted purple mantle hung
 Upon his shoulders bare. 

The shade of his translucid face
 Was white, as white as snow –
 A handsome corpse with living eyes
 That cast abroad their glow. 

‘However hard, I left my skin
 To gratify your plea,
 My father is the heaven high,
 My mother is the sea. 

To slip into your room and, dumb,
 To gaze at you from near,
 Down with my azure am I come,
 Born from the waters’ sphere. 

O come, my treasure! Leave afar
 The world where you abide;
 My love, I am the evening star
 And you shall be my bride. 

We shall the coral castles gain,
 There will you dwell for aye,
 And all the people of the main
 Shall unto you obey.’ 

‘You are so very handsome, yea,
 Like angels in a dream –
 But I shall never go the way
 You show me with your beam. 

You’re alien-spoken, alien-bred,
 And lifeless is your glow,
 I am alive and you are dead,
 Your eyes they freeze me so.’ 

There passed a day, then three, then four,
 The night closed in again,
 And over her the star once more
 His beams serene did rain. 

By images of his o’erawed
 So often in her sleep,
 She felt a yearning for the lord
 Of the unquiet deep. 

‘Descend, o sweet Hyperion,
 Glide down upon a ray
 Into my home and thoughts anon
 And brighten up my way.’ 

When, from above, he heard the girl,
 The evening-star shone dead,
 The skies began to reel and whirl
 Where used to be his stead;

With crimson torches in the air,
 The world’s far ends are rife,
 And from the valleys of nowhere
 A proud shape comes to life;

And on the locks of his black hair
 The crown seems all ablaze;
 He came and floated, one would swear,
 As bathed in the sun’s rays. 

The marble arms form the black shroud
 Reach out as for embrace,
 He comes so pensive, sad and proud,
 And wax-pale is his face;

But his large eyes, of eerie spell,
 Chimerically spark,
 Two passions bottomless and fell
 And overfull of dark. 

‘Twas hard to leave my sphere and come
 And lend to you my ear,
 The night she is my mother glum,
 The sun, my father dear. 

O, come, my treasure! Leave afar
 The world where you abide;
 My love, I am the evening star
 And you shall be my bride. 

O, come, and on your fair-haired head
 A wreath of stars I’ll lay,
 That from my heavens you may shed
 More glorious light than they.’ 

‘You are as handsome as in sleep
 Can but a daemon be;
 Yet never shall I take and keep
 The path you show to me. 

My heartstrings ache when every eve
 You vent your cruel desire,
 Your eyes, so gloomy, make me grieve,
 And scorching is their fire.’ 

‘How could I possibly descend? 
You ought to realize
 That my life here will have no end,
 Whilst yours just gleams and dies.’ 

‘I do not make of words a choice,
 I know not how to start,
 Though you speak clearly, with men’s voice,
 I fail to read your heart;

But if you really want that I
 Should your beloved be,
 Descend on earth from there on high,
 Be mortal just like me.’ 

‘My immortality you take
 As ransom for a kiss;
 Yet you must know how sore I ache,
 How sore your love I miss;

I shall be born, whate’er betide,
 In sin, take a new law;
 Though to eternity I’m tied,
 I shall be tied no more.’ 

And off he goes ... For a girl’s love
 E’er faster does he wend,
 Estranged from his abode above,
 And lost for days on end. 

At this time, cunning Cătălin,
 A boy brought up so fine,
 That at each sumptuous banquet scene
 He fills the cups of wine,

A page who step by step does hold
 The robe-trains of the queen,
 A tramp born out of wedlock, bold,
 With eyes unduly keen,

With cheeks like rosy flowers in bloom,
 On tiptoe, oh the sinner! 
He steals into the dim-lit room
 To look at Cătălina. 

My goodness! She is near her prime ... 
How lovely is the duck! 
Well, Cătălin, now is the time
 For you to try your luck. 

So when she slid into a nook,
 He clasped her unawares. 
‘What is it, Cătălin? Now look –
 Go, mind your own affairs!’ 

‘What is it?! Thinking stifles you,
 And you call that great fun! 
You’d better smile and give me, do,
 A hearty kiss, just one.’ 

‘I don’t know what you ask, or why –
 Leave me in peace, be gone! 
I’m deadly love-sick, and on high
 Is he – Hyperion.’ 

‘You don’t’ know! Well, I can – I bet –
 Show you, and piecemeal, too,
 What is love – only do not fret,
 And hold your peace, mind you. 

As in the grove the fowler lays
 His snare upon the tree,
 When I reach out my arm sideways,
 With both your arms clasp me;

Then, as I gaze into your eyes,
 Don’t move them to and fro,
 And when I lift you up, just rise
 On tiptoe and stand so;

And, also, when my face bends down,
 Do hold your face supine,
 A lifetime in your looks I’ll drown
 And you will melt in mine. 

So that your love may fully know
 And all its magic learn,
 When, kissing you, I bend full low,
 Do kiss me in your turn.’ 

She listened listless to the boy,
 Though struck by his strange tone,
 She was now passionate, now coy,
 Now hostile, now half-prone. 

She quoth, ‘I knew you from a child,’
 In a low voice she quoth,
 ‘A mouthy ne’er-do-well, and wild,
 We’d get on smoothly both. 

A star, however, born to freeze
 In bleak oblivion’s quiet,
 Lends scope unbounded to the sea’s
 Vast solitude and riot;

My lashes secretly I bend
 For I can’t choose but cry
 When the sea’s foamy billows tend
 Towards his seat on high. 

To soothe my grief he shines so bright,
 With love that can’t be told,
 But he attains e’er greater height,
 E’er farther for my hold. 

He sadly comes with his cold ray
 From his own world, earth-proof,
 For aye I’ll love him and for aye
 He will remain aloof. 

And that is why my days are dry
 As is a desert land,
 So hallowed, yet, the nights that I
 Their charm can’t understand.’ 

‘You’re just a girl, that’s what you are ... 
Let’s travel far and wide,
 They’ll lose our traces near and far
 And think that we have died. 

We shall be wise and gay, we’ll roam
 Sound both in mind and limb,
 You will forget your parents’ home,
 And all star-prompted whim.’ 

Off went the star. And as he went,
 His wings grew more and more
 And myriads of years were spent
 For every hour that wore. 

There was a sky of stars beneath,
 A sky of stars o’erhead –
 Like to a bolt with ne’er a death
 Among the worlds he sped. 

And from the valleys of the pit
 He upwards spun his way;
 He saw how lights sprang up and lit
 As on the earliest day,

How like a sea they girdled him,
 And swam and heaved about ... 
And flew and flew, an ache-borne whim
 Till everything died out;

For where he reached there was no bourn,
 To see there was no eye,
 And from the chaos to be born
 Time vainly made a try. 

And there was nothing. There was, though,
 A thirst that did oppress,
 A gaping gulf above, below,
 Like blind forgetfulness. 

‘From heavy, dark eternity
 Deliver me, of Lord,
 For ever hallowed may’st Thou be
 And praised throughout the world! 

O, ask me, Father, anything
 But change my fortune now;
 O’er Fount of Life Thou art the king,
 The death-dispenser Thou;

My aura of eternity,
 My fiery looks retrieve,
 And, in exchange, for love grant me
 A single hour’s leave. 

From chaos come, I would return
 To chaos, oh, most Blessed,
 For out of rest eternal born,
 I yearn again for rest.’ 

‘Wan star, which from the world’s confines
 Dost with the cosmos rise,
 Ask not for miracles and signs
 That have no name nor guise! 

What, wouldst thou deem thyself to be
 A fellow of those men? 
If all of them drowned in the sea,
 Men would be born again. 

For, it is men alone who, blind,
 Build castles in the air;
 When waves have found their grave, behind,
 Waves simmer everywhere;

Or lucky stars or Fate’s disgrace
 Are only humans’ lot,
 While we have neither time nor place
 And death can strike us not. 

From yesterday’s eternal womb
 Lives now whatever dies,
 And if a sun should meet its doom,
 New suns would mount the skies. 

Although they seem e’er to ascend,
 Death pricks them with his thorn,
 All that are born die in the end
 To live on a new morn. 

Hyperion thou must remain
 Wherever thou dost rise ... 
Wouldst thou hear my first word again
 And so become more wise? 

Wilt thou that I my mouth should ope
 To sing the song that wiles
 The mountains with their wooded slope,
 The sea’s uncounted isles? 

Or wilt thou prove by deed thy worth,
 That right and might canst helm? 
I would in clods give thee the earth
 To make it a great realm! 

Or give the vessels, masts on masts,
 And hosts that land and sea
 Will cross, the power to ride and blast,
 But death – that cannot be ... 

And when, think’st thou, thy death is worth? 
Turn back, turn down once more
 And see what on the straying earth
 There is for three in store.’ 

Hyperion finds back his way
 To his predestined stead
 And, once again, as yesterday,
 His radiant light does shed. 

The sun does with the dusk compete,
 The night will gather soon,
 Out of the waters, trembling, sweet,
 Uprises the full moon. 

To gild with sparkles the soft breeze,
 The paths in grass unmown. 
Under a clump of linden-trees
 A young pair sat alone. 

‘O, rest my head upon your breast! 
There, sweetheart, let it lie,
 Under the heaven’s eye, more blest,
 More sweet with every sigh;

Imbue my thoughts for evermore
 With your light’s frozen balm,
 Upon my light of passion pour
 Your everlasting calm. 

Abide o’er me and from above
 Assuage with your pale beam
 My grief, for you are my first love
 And, also, my last dream.’ 

Hyperion, in heavens, read
 Amaze upon their face;
 No sooner had he clasped her head
 That she did him embrace ... 

Two children with long flaxen hair
 Are lying ‘mid the flowers,
 Upon the blooms fall from the air
 In scented, silver showers. 

Love-struck, she raises up her eyes
 And sees the star. Afire
 She trusts him in a gentle wise
 With her unquenched desire:

‘Descend, o mild Hyperion,
 Glide down upon a ray
 Into the woods and thoughts anon,
 Light up my fortune’s way!’ 

He trembles as he often would
 In forests, hills and leas,
 And guides the awesome solitude
 Of ever restless seas. 

Yet he no more, as yesterday,
 Falls down into the sea;
 ‘What dost thou care, o, shape of clay,
 If it is I or he? 

You live accompanied by weal
 In your all-narrow fold,
 Whilst in my boundless world I feel
 Both deathless and dead cold.’
