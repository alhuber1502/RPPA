To Zakynthos

I shall not touch the sacred shores again
Where as a boy I laid my body down,
My Zakynthos, who see yourself in waves
Of the Greek sea where the virgin was born,

Venus, she who made these islands fertile
With her first smile, and so your name rang,
With your transparent clouds and green leafage,
ln the famous verse of him who sang

The fateful waters and scattered exile
Through which, lovely with fame and affliction,
Ulysses kissed his rocky Ithaca.

You will have, my mother land, nothing more
Than the song of your son, for destiny
Ordained for us an unwept sepulcher.
