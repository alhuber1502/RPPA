Field-marshal Radetzky

Lead on, Commander, lead our cause! 
‘Tis more than glory beckons,
 Austria is united in your camp
 While we are scattered fragments. 

Our folly and our vanity
 Have split us into factions
 But when you lead your men to war
 One spirit guides their actions. 

Yet which of them would dare to claim
 The wisdom that you own? 
To see our dreams and hopes fulfilled:
 That vision is yours alone. 

Your guard does more than keep the watch;
 It keeps us safe from harm
 And fearlessly defends our cause
 When nightly sounds the alarm. 

Your camp – a city on the move –
 Is all things to your men;
 If flames destroy it they’ll go down
 And never rise again. 

Your ministers and generals
 Fear not to use their swords
 To keep obedience in peace,
 And peace in midst of wars. 

Slavs and Magyars have no dispute
 Linguistic or sectarian;
 The call ‘Vorwärts’ means but one thing
 In Czech or in Hungarian. 

For mutual help in mutual need
 Has founded many a nation;
 Death alone divides mankind,
 Life binds in aspiration. 

May your glorious war inspire us
 To extend our hands in union. 
When each and all are so conjoined
 The victory will be won.
