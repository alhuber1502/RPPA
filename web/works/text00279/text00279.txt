Sweet Meat Has Sour Sauce, or The Slave Trader in the Dumps

A trader I am to the African shore,
 But since that my trading is like to be o’er
 I’ll sing you a song which you ne’er heard before,
 Which nobody can deny, deny,
 Which nobody can deny! 

When I first heard the news it gave me a shock
 Much like what they call an electrical knock,
 And now I am going to sell off my stock
 Which nobody can deny, deny,
 Which nobody can deny! 

’Tis a curious assortment of dainty regales
 To tickle the negroes with when the ship sails –
 Fine chains for the neck, and a cat with nine tails,
 Which nobody can deny, deny,
 Which nobody can deny! 

Here’s supple-jack plenty, and store of rattan
 That will wind itself round the sides of a man
 As close as a hoop round a bucket or can,
 Which nobody can deny, deny,
 Which nobody can deny! 

Here’s padlocks and bolts and screws for the thumbs
 That squeeze them so lovingly till the blood comes,
 They sweeten the temper like comfits or plums
 Which nobody can deny, deny,
 Which nobody can deny! 

When a negro his head from his victuals withdraws
 And clenches his teeth and thrusts out his paws,
 Here’s a notable engine to open his jaws –
 Which nobody can deny, deny,
 Which nobody can deny! 

Thus, going to market, we kindly prepare
 A pretty black cargo of African ware
 For what they must meet with when they get there,
 Which nobody can deny, deny,
 Which nobody can deny! 

’Twould do your heart good to see ’em below
 Lie flat on their backs all the way as we go
 Like sprats on a gridiron, scores in a row! 
Which nobody can deny, deny,
 Which nobody can deny! 

But ah, if in vain I have studied an art
 So gainful to me (all boasting apart),
 I think it will break my compassionate heart –
 Which nobody can deny, deny,
 Which nobody can deny! 

For oh, how it enters my soul like an awl:
 This pity (which some people self-pity call)
 Is sure the most heart-piercing pity of all! 
Which nobody can deny, deny,
 Which nobody can deny! 

So this is my song – as I told you before –
 Come buy off my stock, for I must no more
 Carry Caesars and Pompeys to Sugar-cane Shore,
 Which nobody can deny, deny,
 Which nobody can deny!
