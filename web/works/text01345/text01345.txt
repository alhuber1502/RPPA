Homer and Ossian

Where have the Greeks gone, where have the Celts gone?
They vanished like
two cities drowned
by the ocean streams
with only their topmost pinnacles breaking the water ...
These topmost pinnacles are two: Homer and Ossian.

One was a beggar and
one was a king’s son. Worlds apart!
But in this they come together:
both of them were blind.
Perhaps the light of their eyes
was lost in the fierce fire of their souls,
outshone and extinguished by glory itself?

Great spirits these! enchanted hands
brushing the lyre-strings,
they reenact the divine word
creating a world for men
which is wonderfully beautiful
and wonderfully great. —

Can you hear Homer?
In his song the sky’s dome
is an eternal smile of the stillness of joy,
and the violet dawn and the gold
of the mid-day sun-ray
pour down from it with such grace
on the blond waves of the sea
and their green islands where
gods delightedly mingling
with men and women pursue
your dazzling game, O love!

And can you see Ossian there?
In the land of endless North Sea mists
with storms massed over savage rocks
he roars his song in the chaos of the night-time.
And the moon comes up
as blood-red as
the sun that goes down
and throws its stark light over a wilderness
haunted by roving clusters
of spirits, dead warriors mourning
their last battle.

Everything that is bright,
everything that is blooming
is in your song, oldest of beggars, Homer!
Everything that is black,
everything that is barren
is in your song, king’s son, Ossian! —

Go on then singing,
pluck the lyre, the divine lyre,
Homer and Ossian!
The years are waiting —
centuries, millenniums — to set their feet on
everything without mercy, oh but
you escape them like things sacred;
their jaundiced fetid breath burns up the world
except where the laurel on your gray heads is evergreen!
