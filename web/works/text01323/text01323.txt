The Neighbor

My gloomy neighbor, who and what are you?
I love you like my dearest friend, I do ...
One jailer, I believe, has seen us,
But we shall never meet, in jail or free:
Today a solid wall, then fate’s decree —
But something always stands between us.

When dusk is near and daylight melts away,
When in my cell I catch the scarlet ray
And see the sun in glory sinking,
And when the guard just leans upon his gun,
Recalling things that he has known and done,
And quietly dozes off, unthinking —

Then to the wall my burning brow I press.
The purport of your songs is hard to guess;
I listen long to them, not knowing
What tales they tell; their sounds are tragic all,
They float and reach me through the prison wall,
Like tears, in sadness flowing, flowing ...

And then again I want to love and strive;
My memories come throbbing and alive,
I feel my world expanding, growing ...
My blood is hot, my mind is free from fears,
I triumph, and I see my grateful tears,
Like sounds, in sweet succession flowing.
