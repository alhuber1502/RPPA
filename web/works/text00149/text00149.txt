The Sun Has Long Been Set

The sun has long been set:
 The stars are out by twos and threes;
 The little birds are piping yet
 Among the bushes and trees;
 There’s a cuckoo, and one or two thrushes,
 And a noise of wind that rushes,
 With a noise of water that gushes,
 And the cuckoo’s sovereign cry
 Fills all the hollow of the sky! 
Who would go ‘parading’
 In London, and ‘masquerading’,
 On such a night of June,
 With that beautiful soft half-moon
 And all those innocent blisses –
 On such a night as this is?
