The Hermit

Come, O world’s comfort, silent night!
Rise from the hills, your step so light
Air’s sleep it does not raise!
Only a sailor who was long
at sea sings a sad evening song
in port to give God praise.

Like clouds, year blows by after year,
leaving me lonely, standing here,
forgotten by the world.
Then, wonderfully, you drew nigh
when near the forests’s rustling I
would sit immersed in thought.

O the world’s comfort, silent night!
The day has tired me, the wide
sea darkens, light is gone.
Let me have rest from joys and woes
until the silent forest glows
in the eternal dawn.
