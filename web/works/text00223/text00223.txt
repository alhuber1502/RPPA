On Sitting Down to Read ‘King Lear’ Once Again

Oh golden-tongued Romance, with serene lute! 
Fair plumed syren, Queen of far-away! 
Leave melodizing on this wintry day –
 Shut up thine olden pages, and be mute. 
Adieu, for, once again, the fierce dispute
 Betwixt damnation and impassioned clay
 Must I burn through – once more humbly assay
 The bitter-sweet of this Shakespearean fruit. 
Chief poet! and ye clouds of Albion
 (Begetters of our deep eternal theme),
 When through the old oak forest I am gone,
 Let me not wander in a barren dream,
 But, when I am consumed in the fire,
 Give me new phoenix-wings to fly at my desire.
