The Wishes

If some young fairy with sapphire wing,
Under an archway dark and cool,
White like the sheen of an Ophir pearl,
Rose before me, with a zephyr’s sound,
Or the spray of a waterfall,

And said: What do you want? Large chests of gold,
Vast palaces, or precious gems?
Speak. My skill is great: Do you need more?
I will give it: A treasure I can make
Of a dry heap of leaves and stems.

I would say: I want a smiling sky
Mirrored in a lake clear and pure,
I want a sun shining in the blue,
A luminous orb that no dark cloud
Or mist or vapor will obscure;

And under me a white horse bounding,
Nimble son of Arabia,
With a long mane and a flashing eye,
That like the hippogrifP flies in an hour
From Norway down to Nubia;

A red kiosque with gilded minarets,
Alabaster columns tall and thin,
Fantastic arches with pendant eggs,
Mosaic wails and colored windows
Through which a bluish day slips in;

And always near me when it is hot
A moving wood of sycamore and oak
Sending the breath of a gentle breeze,
Like a great fan lifting up and down
Its massive foliage of silk.

I want a tartan with a sailing crew
And sails of white, and ropes and spars,
And a copper corset where waves break
Rocking me mildly by opulent isles
Under softly glimmering stars.

I want to wake and fall asleep each time
To the sound of Italian choirs,
And hear all day the distant tremor
Of Bendemir’s murmuring river,
Or of Aeolian lyres;

With cashmere scarf and naked breasts
I want a dancing alma
With brilliant rubies on her brow,
And spahis and harems, like a sultan
Of Baghdad or Palmyra;

A Turkish sword, an Indian knife
With handle of sapphire or pearl —
But I want most a heart that’s made for mine,
That feels and loves and understands it well,
The innocent heart of a girl.
