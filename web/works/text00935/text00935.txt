Sonnet

[“Stern Dante did not despise the sonnet”]

Stern Dante did not despise the sonnet;
Petrarch filled it with his ardent love;
The maker of Macbeth was taken with it;
Camoens would weave his sorrows in its cloth.

Even now it captivates the poet:
Wordsworth chose the sonnet as his form
When in his refuge from the hectic world
He painted scenes of nature’s ideal realm.

In the shadow of the Taurid mountains
The bard of Lithuania would seal
Within its narrow frame his every dream.

Our maidens here had not yet known it
Till Delvig abandoned for its sake
The classic hexameter’s sacred theme.
