To Julie

They quiz me in the street because
I go round gaping after whores,
Puffing cigar-smoke in the sun;
What am I doing with my youth?
And after three full years of sloth,
What prizes have my white nights won?

Julie, give me your lips again:
These crazy nights untan the skin
And make their shining coral dull —
Revive them with a scented puff
Of your moist breath, my African love,
Lips of pure blood, and beautiful.

My printer shouts across the city
That his machine is always ready,
But mine’s worn out. And decent men,
The prophets of small clubs, are letting
Their circles know they don’t mind betting
I shan’t get back the use of my pen.

Julie, got any Spanish rouge in?
Yesterday’s lost in such confusion.
Go look, in case we spared a bottle.
My God, your mouth is burning, Julie;
Let’s work out something mad, and really
Get wasted, absolutely mortal.

This is the crop of my wild oats,
They say; and once I had some guts;
And I’ve become so blank it’s frightening.
I think, if I were worth the fare,
They’d send me to Napoleon’s lair,
With (in my chest) a cancer beating.

Julie, you must expect some day
I’ll burst in flames and burn away,
Like Hercules on his hilltop fire.
Since you’re the death of me, come nearer:
Open your robe, Deianira,
So I can mount my funeral pyre.
