On the Death of His Brother Giovanni

[Sonnet 10]

One day, if I am not forever fleeing
From people to people, you will see me sitting
On your stone, O my brother, shedding tears
For the fallen flower of your gentle years.

Mother, drawing out her late day now, alone,
Talks about me to your silent ashes:
While to both of you I stretch deluded hands
And alone from afar I salute my home.

I feel the hostile gods, and the secret grief
That stirred up such a tempest in your life,
While in your harbor I too pray for rest.

Of so many hopes now only this remains:
O Strangers, at least give back my bones
To my poor mother's grieving breast.
