Stepping Westward

‘What, you are stepping westward?’ ‘Yea.’ 
’Twould be a wildish destiny
 If we, who thus together roam
 In a strange land, and far from home,
 Were in this place the guests of Chance. 
Yet who would stop, or fear to advance,
 Though home or shelter he had none,
 With such a sky to lead him on? 

The dewy ground was dark and cold –
 Behind, all gloomy to behold –
 And stepping westward seemed to be
 A kind of heavenly destiny. 
I liked the greeting! ’Twas a sound
 Of something without place or bound,
 And seemed to give me spiritual right
 To travel through that region bright. 

The voice was soft, and she who spake
 Was walking by her native lake;
 The salutation had to me
 The very sound of courtesy. 
Its power was felt – and while my eye
 Was fixed upon the glowing sky,
 The echo of the voice inwrought
 A human sweetness with the thought
 Of travelling through the world that lay
 Before me in my endless way.
