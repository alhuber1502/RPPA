When the Sky Clears

The drop grows happy by losing itself in the river.
A pain when beyond human range becomes something else.

One manâ€™s heart died when he insisted on treating his own problems.
Sometimes people solve jute-knots by rubbing them on rocks.

Since I am weak, I sigh instead of weeping.
My experience tells me that water can change and become air.

The sky abruptly clears following thick clouds and heavy rain.
The clouds, recognizing separation, cried and vanished into nonexistence.

We make the back of the mirror green in order to see our faces.
Sometimes nature makes the front of the mirror green as well.

We love seeing the beauty of poppies and lilies.
When the eyes lose themselves in the colors, they are seeing at last.
