A Cottage in Grasmere Vale

Peaceful our valley, fair and green,
 And beautiful her cottages,
 Each in its nook, its sheltered hold,
 Or guarded by its tuft of trees. 

Many and beautiful they are,
 But there is one that I love best,
 A lowly shed in truth it is,
 A brother of the rest. 

Yet when I sit on rock or hill,
 Down-looking on the valley fair,
 That cottage with its clustering trees
 Summons my heart – it settles there. 

Others there are whose small domain
 Of fertile fields and hedgerows green
 Might more entice a wanderer’s mind
 To wish that there his home had been. 

Such wish be his, I blame him not –
 My fancy is unfettered, wild –
 I love that house because it is
 The very mountains’ child! 

Fields hath it of its own, green fields,
 But they are craggy, steep and bare;
 Their fence is of the mountain-stone
 And moss and lichen flourish there. 

And when the storm comes from the north
 It lingers near that pastoral spot,
 And piping through the mossy walls,
 It seems delighted with its lot. 

And let it take its own delight,
 And let it range the pastures bare,
 Until it reach that group of trees –
 It may not enter there! 

A green unfading grove it is,
 Skirted with many a lesser tree –
 Hazel and holly, beech and oak –
 A bright and flourishing company! 

Precious the shelter of those trees,
 They screen the cottage that I love;
 The sunshine pierces to the roof
 And the tall pine-trees tower above.
