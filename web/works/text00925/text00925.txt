Inspiration

Inspiration, all too seldom, comes
And burns a single instant in the soul,
But the beloved of the muses holds
This instant dear, a kind of martyrdom.

The lies of friends, the loss of faith in love,
The poisoning that reaches to the heart
Are all forgotten, the ecstatic bard
Has read the fate he is the hero of.

Despised, abandoned by the masses, he
Drifts, a will-oâ€™-the-wisp beneath the heavens,
Conversing with the coming centuries;

Honor above all things he takes as given,
With his own fame avenges calumnies
And finds within himself divinity.
