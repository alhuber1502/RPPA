The Soul of Poetry

What else no speech could utter,
 No power of words unseal,
 The music of the poet
 Availeth to reveal. 

Out of the verse-form’s texture
 So rigorously wrought
 A free-born spirit rises,
 The poet’s primal thought. 

It dwelt long, long within him
 In formless, vague desire,
 And there the ore of language
 Was melted by its fire. 

It steeps the words like fragrance
 That hearts of roses hold,
 To breathe out in the springtime
 When first their buds unfold. 

And though ’tis never fettered
 In logic’s printed net,
 Like perfume in the rose leaves
 Its presence lingers yet. 

Heed not the ancient adage,
 When fools and dullards mourn
 That art can never capture
 The spark whence thought is born. 

For if the printed symbol
 Could hold it when ‘twas caught,
 Its force, its very being
 Would quickly come to naught. 

It craves the right of spirits
 To float as in a trance,
 And on the wings of rhythm
 To find brief utterance,

To seek the reader’s bosom
 And there to live again
 In re-awakened beauty
 A life of joy or pain,

To grow there, to be nourished
 Within its new-found nest,
 And be once more the fire
 That filled the poet’s breast. 

’Tis only there the radiance
 of poetry is shed,
 what else no speech could utter
 may only there be said. 

What rapture has the poet,
 How fervent, deep and strong,
 While this his spirit passes
 From breast to breast in song! 

When transient tongues exalt him
 And critics praise his art –
 He finds not there the solace
 He longed for in his heart. 

But when his glowing vision,
 Unknown to common fame,
 Finds out another bosom
 And springs once more to flame –

O tell him that his spirit
 Once more is burning high;
 That is his one assurance
 His poem cannot die.
