The Prophet

When people’s eyes I learned to read
With the omniscience of a prophet,
I noticed malice, envy, greed,
And a disgraceful thirst for profit.

The truth of friendship I proclaimed —
Alas for my misguided labor!
I was tormented and defamed
By every relative and neighbor.

And then with ashes on my head
I left the town, my courage failing;
Now in the wilderness my bread
Is what the Lord can give me daily.

Unharmed by beasts and snakes, I preach;
I speak, and silent planets listen;
My words as far as Heaven reach,
And stare in satisfaction glisten.

But when I cross a noisy street
And move along, morose and ugly,
The elders, bursting with conceit,
Address their youngsters, grinning smugly,

“Just look at him! How high he soared!
He treated all of us like vermin.
He thought that the Almighty Lord
Proclaimed commandments through his sermon.

But look at what the man has done!
Today he is hungry, gaunt, dejected,
Despised by everyone, rejected,
A naked wretch, a friend to none.”
