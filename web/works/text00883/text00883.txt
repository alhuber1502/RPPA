To the Muse

[Sonnet 11]

You still poured the abundant soul of song
Upon my lips awhile, Aonian Muse,
When the brief season of my flowering years
Was taking flight, but this later one walks long

Beside me on the path of loss and pain
That draws us down to Lethe's silent shore:
I still invoke you, but am heard no more,
And of your spirit only sparks remain.

For you have fled, escorted by the Hours,
O Goddess! leaving heavy memories
And panic fear of what is yet to be.

But I know, and love repeats it many times,
That my laborious and scattered rhymes
Can scarcely speak the grief that dwells with me.
