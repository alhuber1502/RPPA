Endymion

[Book I, ll. 777 – 802]

Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks
 Our ready minds to fellowship divine,
 A fellowship with essence, till we shine
 Full alchemized, and free of space. Behold
 The clear religion of Heaven! Fold
 A roseleaf round thy finger’s taperness
 And soothe thy lips. Hist, when the airy stress
 Of music’s kiss impregnates the free winds,
 And with a sympathetic touch unbinds
 Eolian magic from their lucid wombs –
 Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs,
 Old ditties sigh above their father’s grave,
 Ghosts of melodious prophesyings rave
 Round every spot where trod Apollo’s foot;
 Bronze clarions awake and faintly bruit
 Where long ago a giant-battle was;
 And, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass
 In every place where infant Orpheus slept. 

Feel we these things? That moment have we stepped
 Into a sort of oneness, and our state
 Is like a floating spirit’s. But there are
 Richer entanglements, enthralments far
 More self-destroying, leading, by degrees,
 To the chief intensity: the crown of these
 Is made of love and friendship, and sits high
 Upon the forehead of humanity.
