The London Beggar

[Prelude VII., ll. 594-622]

How often in the overflowing streets
 Have I gone forwards with the crowd, and said
 Unto myself ‘The face of everyone
 That passes by me is a mystery!’ 
Thus have I looked, nor ceased to look, oppressed
 By thoughts of what and whither, when and how,
 Until the shapes before my eyes became
 A second-sight procession such as glides
 Over still mountains, or appears in dreams,
 And all the ballast of familiar life
 (The present and the past, hope, fear, all stays –
 All laws – of acting, thinking, speaking man)
 Went from me, neither knowing me, nor known. 
And once, far travelled in such mood, beyond
 The reach of common indications, lost
 Amid the moving pageant, ’twas my chance
 Abruptly to be smitten with the view
 Of a blind beggar, who, with upright face,
 Stood propped against a wall, upon his chest
 Wearing a written paper to explain
 The story of the man, and who he was. 
My mind did at this spectacle turn round
 As with the might of waters, and it seemed
 To me that in this label was a type
 Or emblem of the utmost that we know
 Both of ourselves and of the universe. 
And on the shape of this unmoving man,
 His fix
                ed
               face and sightless eyes, I looked
 As if admonished from another world.
