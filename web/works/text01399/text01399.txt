The Hesperides

The North-wind fall’n, in the new-starréd night
 Zidonian Hanno, voyaging beyond
 The hoary promontory of Soloë
 Past Thymiaterion, in calméd bays,
 Between the southern and the western Horn,
 Heard neither warbling of the nightingale,
 Nor melody of the Libyan lotus flute
 Blown seaward from the shore; but from a slope
 That ran bloom-bright into the Atlantic blue,
 Beneath a highland leaning down a weight
 Of cliffs, and zoned below with cedar shade,
 Came voices, like the voices in a dream,
 Continuous, till he reached the outer sea.
