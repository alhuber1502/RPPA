Isabelle

[Ll. 1-40]

Can there be a moon in heaven tonight,
 That the hill and gray cloud seem so light? 
The air is whitened by some spell,
 For there is no moon, I know it well;
 On this third day the sages say –
 ’Tis wonderful how well they know! –
 The moon is journeying far away,
 Bright somewhere in a heaven below. 

It is a strange and lovely night,
 A grayish pale, but not white! 
Is it rain, or is it dew,
 That falls so thick I see its hue? 
In rays it follows, one, two, three,
 Down the air so merrily;
 Said Isabelle, ‘So let it be!’ 

Why does the Lady Isabelle
 Sit in the damp and dewy dell
 Counting the racks of drizzly rain? 
And how often the rail cries over again,
 For she’s harping, harping, in the brake,
 ‘Craik, craik, craik, craik’ –
 Ten times nine, and thrice eleven;
 That last call was an hundred and seven! 
‘Craik, craik, the hour is near!’ 
Let it come, I have no fear –
 Yet it is a dreadful work, I wis,
 Such doings in a night like this! 
Sounds the river harsh and loud? 
The stream sounds harsh, but not loud. 
There is a cloud that seems to hover
 By western hill the churchyard over –
 What is it like? ’Tis like a whale! 
’Tis like a shark with half the tail –
 Not half, but a third and more –
 Now ’tis a wolf, and now a boar;
 Its face is raised, it cometh here –
 Let it come, there is no fear! 
There’s two for Heaven, and ten for Hell –
 ‘Let it come, ’tis well, ’tis well!’ 
Said the Lady Isabelle.
