Nabucco

[‘The Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves’]

Go, thought, on wings of gold,
 go alight upon the slopes and the hills
 where the sweet breezes of our
 native land smell warm [free] and gentle! 
Greet the banks of the river Jordan
 and Zion’s fallen towers. 
Oh, my fatherland, so beautiful and lost! 
Oh remembrance so dear and unhappy! 
Golden harp of the prophetic bards,
 why hang so silently from the willows? 
Rekindle the memories in our hearts,
 tell us about the times gone by! 
O like Solomon to the fates
 draw us the sound of a sad lament
 or may the Lord inspire in you an accord
 which infuses our suffering with virtue.
