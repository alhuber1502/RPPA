Dante

By his waters deep, I stood there contemplating. 
Flat the surface lay, and full of shadows grave;
 And atop it, petals, gently undulating,
 Like a hardly-noticed earthquake’s subtle wave. 
Clear as steel, its mirror faithfully reflected
 What it found outside – and me: the human world;
 He alone – perhaps not even he – detected
 Turbulence with which, deep down, the water swirled. 

Marvelous his spirit! One with the unending
 Heaven that’s reflected here before my eyes! 
Just as far beyond all grasping, comprehending,
 Equal in its grandeur, equal in its size! 
And the man ... the poet (wretched rascal’s label!) 
Trembling, drops his worthless laurels to the sod;
 And, as if before a church’s altar table,
 Prayerful, he kneels earthward, for he senses God. 

Such a depth makes reason’s plumbline grows unsteady,
 Float as if with feather weighted, not with lead. 
Consciousness accepts it’s caught up in the eddy. 
Wondrous divination fills the human head. 
It can feel the pull of other-worldly quarters;
 Shudders at the dread and pleasures they afford;
 Hears Leviathan go thrashing in the waters ... 
Onto which has passed the presence of the Lord. 

Is it part of the one Godhead, then, this spirit? 
After all, the Godhead’s one unbroken whole. 
And the spirit world, could mortal see or hear it,
 When his conscious mind is fully in control? 
One millennium sets and one millennium rises,
 Till a mortal’s dream into that world will stray,
 Till the unbelieving person recognizes
 That mist-hidden Godhead to which he must pray.
