The Last Man

’Twas in the year two thousand and one,
 A pleasant morning of May,
 I sat on the gallows-tree all alone,
 A chanting a merry lay –
 To think how the pest had spared my life
 To sing with the larks that day! 

When up the heath came a jolly knave,
 Like a scarecrow all in rags;
 It made me crow to see his old duds
 All abroad in the winds like flags –
 So up he came to the timbers’ foot
 And pitched down his greasy bags. 

Good Lord, how blithe the old beggar was
 At pulling out his scraps –
 The very sight of his broken orts
 Made a work in his wrinkled chaps! 
‘Come down’, says he, ‘you Newgate-bird,
 And have a taste of my snaps!’ 

Then down the rope, like a tar from the mast,
 I slided, and by him stood;
 But I wished myself on the gallows again
 When I smelt that beggar’s food –
 A foul beef-bone, and a mouldy crust –
 ‘Oh’, quoth he, ‘the Heavens are good!’ 

Then, after this grace, he cast him down:
 Says I, ‘You’ll get sweeter air
 A pace or two off, on the windward side’ –
 For the felons’ bones lay there! 
But he only laughed at the empty skulls,
 And offered them part of his fare. 

‘I never harmed them, and they won’t harm me –
 Let the proud and the rich be cravens!’ 
I did not like that strange beggar-man,
 He looked up so at the Heaven –
 Anon he shook out his empty old poke:
 ‘There’s the crumbs’, saith he, ‘for the ravens!’ 

It made me angry to see his face,
 It had such a jesting look;
 But while I made up my mind to speak,
 A small case-bottle he took:
 Quoth he, ‘Though I gather the green watercress,
 My drink is not of the brook!’ 
Full manners-like he tendered the dram –
 Oh it came of a dainty cask –
 But whenever it came to his turn to pull:
 ‘Your leave, good sir, I must ask;
 But I always wipe the brim with my sleeve
 When a hangman sups at my flask!’ 

And then he laughed so loudly and long,
 The churl was quite out of breath –
 I thought the very Old One was come
 To mock me before my death,
 And wished I had buried the dead men’s bones
 That were lying about the heath. 

But the beggar gave me a jolly clap:
 ‘Come, let us pledge each other,
 For all the wide world is dead beside’
 And we are brother and brother –
 I’ve a yearning for thee in my heart
 As if we had come from one mother. 

I’ve a yearning for thee in my heart
 That almost makes me weep,
 For as I passed from town to town
 The folks were all stone-asleep,
 But when I saw thee sitting aloft
 It made me both laugh and leap!’ 

Now a curse (I thought) be on his love,
 And a curse be on his mirth,
 An’ it were not for that beggar-man
 I’d be the King of the Earth –
 But I promised myself an hour should come
 To make him rue his birth. 

So down we sat and boused again
 Till the sun was in mid-sky,
 When, just as the gentle west wind came,
 We hearkened a dismal cry:
 ‘Up, up on the tree’, quoth the beggar-man,
 ‘Till those horrible dogs go by!’ 

And lo, from the forest’s far-off skirts
 They came all yelling for gore,
 A hundred hounds all yelling at once,
 And a panting hart before –
 Till he sunk down at the gallows’ foot,
 And there his haunches they tore! 

His haunches they tore, without a horn
 To tell when the chase was done,
 And there was not a scarlet coat
 To flaunt it in the sun –
 I turned and looked at the beggar-man,
 And his tears dropped one by one. 

And with curses sore he chid the hounds,
 Till the last dropped out of sight –
 Anon saith he, ‘Let’s down again,
 And ramble for our delight,
 For the world’s all free, and we may choose
 A right cozy barn for tonight!’ 

With that he set up his staff on end
 And it fell with the point due west;
 So we fared that way to a city great
 Where the folks had died of the pest –
 It was fine to enter in house and hall
 Wherever it liked me best! 

For the porters all were stiff and cold,
 And could not lift their heads;
 And when we came where their masters lay,
 The rats leapt out of the beds –
 The grandest palaces in the land
 Were as free as workhouse-sheds. 

But the beggar-man made a mumping face,
 And knocked at every gate:
 It made me curse to hear how he whined,
 So our fellowship turned to hate,
 And I bade him walk the world by himself,
 For I scorned so humble a mate. 

So he turned right, and I turned left,
 As if we had never met,
 And I chose a fair stone-house for myself,
 For the city was all to let –
 And for three brave holydays drank my fill
 Of the choicest I could get! 

And because my jerkin was coarse and worn
 I got me a properer vest;
 It was purple velvet, stitched over with gold,
 And a shining star at the breast –
 ’Twas enough to fetch old Joan from her grave,
 To see me so purely dressed! 

But Joan was dead, and under the mould,
 And every buxom lass –
 In vane I watched at the window-pane
 For a Christian soul to pass,
 But sheep and kine wandered up the street
 And browsed on the new-come grass. 

When lo, I spied the old beggar-man,
 And lustily he did sing;
 His rags were lapped in a scarlet cloak,
 And a crown he had, like a king –
 So he stepped right up before my gate
 And danced me a saucy fling! 

Heaven mend us all – but within my mind
 I had killed him then and there
 To see him lording so braggart-like
 That was born to his beggar’s fare –
 And now he had stolen the royal crown
 His betters were meant to wear! 

But God forbid that a thief should die
 Without his share of the laws! 
So I nimbly whipped my tackle out
 And soon tied up his claws –
 I was judge myself, and jury, and all,
 And solemnly tried the cause. 
But the beggar-man would not plead, but cried
 Like a babe without its corals,
 For he knew how hard it is apt to go
 When the law and a thief have quarrels –
 There was not a Christian soul alive
 To speak a word for his morals! 

Oh how gaily I doffed my costly gear
 And put on my workday clothes –
 I was tired of such long Sunday life,
 And was never one of the sloths;
 But the beggar-man grumbled a weary deal,
 And made many crooked mouths. 

So I hauled him off to the gallows’ foot,
 And blinded him in his bags;
 ’Twas a weary job to heave him up
 (For a doomed man always lags),
 But by ten of the clock he was off his legs
 In the wind and airing his rags! 

So there he hung, and there I stood
 The LAST MAN left alive,
 To have my own will of all the earth:
 Quoth I, ‘Now I shall thrive!’ 
But when was ever honey made
 With one bee in a hive? 

My conscience began to gnaw my heart
 Before the day was done,
 For other men’s lives had all gone out
 Like candles in the sun –
 But it seemed as if I had broke at last
 A thousand necks in one! 

So I went and cut his body down
 To bury it decently
 (God send there were any soul alive
 To do the same by me),
 But the wild dogs came with a terrible speed,
 And bayed me up the tree. 
My sight was like a drunkard’s sight,
 And my head began to swim,
 To see their jaws all white with foam
 Like the ravenous ocean’s brim –
 But when the wild dogs trotted away
 Their jaws were bloody and grim! 

Their jaws were bloody and grim, good Lord,
 But the beggar-man, where was he? 
There was nought of him but some ribbons of rags
 Below the gallows-tree –
 I know the Devil, when I am dead,
 Will send his hounds for me! 

I’ve buried my babies one by one,
 And dug the deep hole for Joan,
 And covered the faces of kith and kin,
 And felt the old churchyard-stone
 Go cold to my heart, full many a time –
 But I never felt so lone! 

For the lion and Adam were company,
 And the tiger him beguiled;
 But the simple kind are foes to my life,
 And the household brutes are wild. 
If the veriest cur would lick my hand,
 I could love it like a child! 

And the beggar-man’s ghost besets my dreams
 At night, to make me madder,
 And my wretched conscience within my breast
 Is stinging like an adder –
 I sigh when I pass the gallows’ foot,
 And look at the rope and ladder! 

For hanging looks sweet – but alas, in vain
 My desperate fancy begs;
 I must turn my cup of sorrows quite up,
 And drink it to the dregs,
 For there is not another man alive
 In the world, to pull my legs!
