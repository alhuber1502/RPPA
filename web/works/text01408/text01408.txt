What did you do to Athens ...

I.

What did you do to Athens, Socrates,
 That the people erected a golden statue to you,
 Having first poisoned you? 
What did you do to Italy, Alighieri,
 That the insincere people built two graves for you,
 Having first driven you out? 
What did you do to Europe, Columbus,
 That they dug you three graves in three places
 Having first shackled you? 
What did you do to your people, Camoens,
 That the sexton had to cover your grave twice,
 After you had starved? 
What in the world are you guilty of, Kosciuszko,
 That two stones in two places bear down on you,
 Having first had no burial place? 
What did you do to the world, Napoleon,
 That you were confined to two graves after your demise,
 Having first been confined? 
What did you do to the people, Mickiewicz?
 ...

II.

So it matters less what urn you rest in,
 Where, when, in what sense and face,
 For thy grave shall yet be re-demolished,
 Otherwise they will proclaim your merits
 And they will be ashamed of the tears shed today,
 And they will shed for thee the tears of another power. 
Those who could not see thee as a man. 

III.

Each of your kind the world cannot
 Accept at once into a peaceful bed,
 And has never taken in, as the age ages. 
For clay into clay blends without ceasing,
 When contradictory bodies clash to a stud
 Later ... or first ...
