The West

And, as a boiling vessel calms once more
When the fire fades, the sea was quieted:
Drawing its still-white surge back from the shore
As if for sleep, it entered its vast bed;

And the sun, falling through the cloud-banks, lay
Suspended on the waves, a rayless sphere;
Then, as a burning ship sinks far away,
Its blood-red disc half dropped past the frontier;

And half the heavens faded, and the breeze
Failed in the air, still, and without a sigh;
Shadows rushed in, and their grey draperies
Effaced all things at sea and in the sky;

And in my own soul, fading comparably,
All worldly noises sank down with the day;
And, as in Nature, something deep in me
Began to weep and bless and ache and pray.

Westward alone one gate was prominent,
Revealing light rippling with gold attire,
And the encrimsoned cloud was like a tent
That veils but does not quench a mighty fire;

The shadows, the gulf-waves, the winds astir —
Toward that fiery arch all seemed to fly,
As if Nature and all that quickens her,
Losing the light, was now afraid to die!

The twilit dust sped to it from the ground,
The white spray rolled to it across the sea;
And my slow sad gaze, idly straying round,
Grew moist with tears that felt no misery.

And all things vanished, and my troubled soul
Remained as vacant as the shrouded land;
Then one thought rose up solitary and whole,
Like a great pyramid in the desert sand.

O light – spent globe of fire — where do you go?
Clouds, winds, and waves, where are you running thus?
Dust, spray, night — eyes, soul of mine — if you know,
Tell us where we are going, all of us!

To you, great Whole! The sun is your dim glow,
In you night, day, and spirit meet their end —
Ubiquitous sacred ebb and flow,
Vast sea of Being, in which all must blend! ...
