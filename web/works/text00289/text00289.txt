The Battle of Blenheim

It was a summer evening,
 Old Kaspar’s work was done,
 And he before his cottage door
 Was sitting in the sun,
 And by him sported on the green
 His little grandchild Wilhelmine. 

She saw her brother Peterkin
 Roll something large and round
 That he beside the rivulet
 In playing there had found;
 He came to ask what he had found
 That was so large, and smooth, and round. 

Old Kaspar took it from the boy
 Who stood expectant by,
 And then the old man shook his head
 And with a natural sigh,
 ‘’Tis some poor fellow’s skull’, said he,
 ‘Who fell in the great victory. 

I find them in the garden for
 There’s many here about,
 And often when I go to plough
 The ploughshare turns them out –
 For many thousand men’, said he,
 ‘Were slain in the great victory.’ 

Now tell us what ’twas all about’,
 Young Peterkin he cries,
 And little Wilhelmine looks up
 With wonder-waiting eyes,
 ‘Now tell us all about the war
 And what they killed each other for.’ 

‘It was the English’, Kaspar cried,
 ‘That put the French to rout,
 But what they killed each other for
 I could not well make out. 
But everybody said’, quoth he,
 ‘That ’twas a famous victory. 

My father lived at Blenheim then,
 Yon little stream hard by –
 They burnt his dwelling to the ground
 And he was forced to fly;
 So with his wife and child he fled,
 Nor had he where to rest his head. 

With fire and sword the country round
 Was wasted far and wide,
 And many a childing mother then
 And new-born infant died. 
But things like that, you know, must be
 At every famous victory. 

They say it was a shocking sight
 After the field was won,
 For many thousand bodies here
 Lay rotting in the sun –
 But things like that you know must be
 After a famous victory. 

Great praise the Duke of Marlborough won,
 And our good Prince Eugene.’ 
‘Why ’twas a very wicked thing!’ 
Said little Wilhelmine. 
‘Nay, nay, my little girl’, quoth he,
 ‘It was a famous victory,

And everybody praised the Duke
 Who such a fight did win.’ 
‘But what good came of it at last?’ 
Quoth little Peterkin. 
‘Why that I cannot tell’, said he,
 ‘But ’twas a famous victory!’
