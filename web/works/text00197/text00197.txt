When Last I Roved

When last I roved these winding wood-walks green,
 Green winding walks, and shady pathways sweet,
 Oft-times would Anna seek the silent scene,
 Shrouding her beauties in the lone retreat. 
No more I hear her footsteps in the shade:
 Her image only in these pleasant ways
 Meets me self-wandering, where in happier days
 I held free converse with the fair-haired maid. 
I passed the little cottage which she loved,
 The cottage which did once my all contain! 
It spake of days which ne’er must come again –
 Spake to my heart, and much my heart was moved:
 ‘Now fair befall thee, gentle maid!’ said I,
 And from the cottage turned me with a sigh.
