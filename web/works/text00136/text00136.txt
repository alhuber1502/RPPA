Ah! Sun-Flower

Ah! sun-flower, weary of time,
 Who countest the steps of the sun,
 Seeking after that sweet golden clime
 Where the travellerâ€™s journey is done,

Where the youth pined away with desire,
 And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,
 Arise from their graves and aspire,
 Where my sun-flower wishes to go.
