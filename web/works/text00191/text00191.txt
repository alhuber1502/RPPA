To the River Itchin

[Sonnet VIII.]

Itchin, when I behold thy banks again,
 Thy crumbling margin, and thy silver breast
 On which the self-same tints still seem to rest,
 Why feels my heart the shivering sense of pain? 
Is it that many a summer’s day has past
 Since in life’s morn I carolled on thy side? 
Is it that oft since then my heart has sighed
 As youth, and hope’s delusive gleams, flew fast? 
Is it that those who circled on thy shore,
 Companions of my youth, now meet no more? 
Whate’er the cause, upon thy banks I bend
 Sorrowing, yet feel such solace at my heart
 As at the meeting of some long-lost friend
 From whom, in happier hours, we wept to part.
