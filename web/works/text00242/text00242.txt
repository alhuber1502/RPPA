The Lass of Fair Wone

Beside the parson’s bower of yew
 Why strays a troubled spright,
 That peaks and pines, and dimly shines
 Thro’ curtains of the night? 

Why steals along the pond of toads
 A gliding fire so blue,
 That lights a spot where grows no grass,
 Where falls no rain nor dew? 

The parson’s daughter once was good,
 And gentle as the dove,
 And young and fair – and many came
 To win the damsel’s love. 

High o’er the hamlet, from the hill
 Beyond the winding stream,
 The windows of a stately house
 In sheen of evening gleam. 

There dwelt, in riot, rout, and roar,
 A lord so frank and free,
 That oft, with inward joy of heart,
 The maid beheld his glee –

Whether he met the dawning day
 In hunting trim so fine,
 Or tapers, sparkling from his hall,
 Beshone the midnight wine. 

He sent the maid his picture, girt
 With diamond, pearl, and gold,
 And silken-paper, sweet with musk,
 This gentle message told:

‘Let go thy sweethearts, one and all! 
Shalt thou be basely woo’d,
 That worthy art to gain the heart
 Of youths of noble blood? 

The tale I would to thee bewray,
 In secret must be said:
 At midnight-hour I’ll seek thy bower –
 Fair lass, be not afraid! 

And when the amorous nightingale
 Sings sweetly to his mate,
 I’ll pipe my quail-call from the field –
 Be kind, nor make me wait.’ 

In cap and mantle clad he came,
 At night, with lonely tread,
 Unseen, and silent as a mist,
 And hush’d the dogs with bread. 

And when the amorous nightingale
 Sung sweetly to his mate,
 She heard his quail-call in the field,
 And, ah, ne’er made him wait! 

The words he whisper’d were so soft
 They won her ear and heart –
 How soon will she who loves believe! 
How deep a lover’s art! 

No lure, no soothing guise, he spar’d,
 To banish virtuous shame;
 He call’d on holy God above,
 As witness to his flame. 

He clasp’d her to his breast, and swore
 To be for ever true:
 ‘O yield thee to my wishful arms,
 Thy choice thou shalt not rue!’ 

And while she strove, he drew her on,
 And led her to the bower,
 So still, so dim – and round about
 Sweet smelt the beans in flower. 

There beat her heart, and heav’d her breast,
 And pleaded every sense –
 And there the glowing breath of lust
 Did blast her innocence! 

But when the fragrant beans began
 Their sallow blooms to shed,
 Her sparkling eyes their lustre lost;
 Her cheek, its roses fled:

And when she saw the pods increase,
 The ruddier cherries strain,
 She felt her silken robe grow tight,
 Her waist new weight sustain. 

And when the mowers went afield,
 The yellow corn to ted,
 She felt her burden stir within,
 And shook with tender dread. 

And when the winds of autumn hist
 Along the stubble-field;
 Then could the damsel’s piteous plight
 No longer be conceal’d. 

Her sire, a harsh and angry man,
 With furious voice revil’d:
 ‘Hence from my sight! I’ll none of thee –
 I harbour not thy child!’ 

And fast, amid her fluttering hair,
 With clench
                ed
               fist he gripes,
 And seiz’d a leathern thong, and lash’d
 Her side with sounding stripes. 

Her lily skin, so soft and white,
 He ribb’d with bloody wales,
 And thrust her out – tho’ black the night,
 Tho’ sleet and storm assails. 

Up the harsh rock, on flinty paths,
 The maiden had to roam –
 On tottering feet she grop’d her way,
 And sought her lover’s home. 

‘A mother thou has made of me,
 Before thou mad’st a wife:
 For this, upon my tender breast,
 These livid stripes are rife –

Behold!’ And then, with bitter sobs,
 She sank upon the floor:
 ‘Make good the evil thou has wrought –
 My injur’d name restore!’ 

‘Poor soul! I’ll have thee hous’d and nurs’d! 
Thy terrors I lament,
 Stay here – we’ll have some further talk –
 The old one shall repent. 

‘I have no time to rest and wait –
 That saves not my good name –
 If thou with honest soul hast sworn,
 O leave me not to shame;

But at the holy altar be
 Our union sanctified:
 Before the people and the priest
 Receive me for thy bride.’ 

‘Unequal matches must not blot
 The honours of my line –
 Art thou of wealth or rank for me
 To harbour thee as mine? 

What’s fit and fair I’ll do for thee:
 Shalt yet retain my love –
 Shalt wed my huntsman – and we’ll then
 Our former transports prove.’ 

‘Thy wicked soul, hard-hearted man,
 May pangs in Hell await –
 Sure, if not suited for thy bride,
 I was not for thy mate! 

Go, seek a spouse of nobler blood,
 Nor God’s just judgements dread! 
So shall, ere long, some base-born wretch
 Defile thy marriage-bed –

Then, traitor, feel how wretched they
 In hopeless shame immerst –
 Then smite thy forehead on the wall,
 While horrid curses burst! 

Roll thy dry eyes in wild despair –
 Unsooth’d thy grinning woe!’ 
Thro’ thy pale temples fire the ball,
 And sink to fiends below. 

Collected then she started up
 And thro’ the hissing sleet,
 Thro’ thorn and briar, thro’ flood and mire,
 She fled with bleeding feet. 

‘Where now’, she cry’d, ‘my gracious God!
 What refuge have I left?’ 
And reach’d the garden of her home,
 Of hope in man bereft. 

On hand and foot she feebly crawl’d
 Beneath the bower unblest,
 Where withering leaves and gathering snow
 Prepar’d her only rest. 

There rending pains and darting throes
 Assail’d her shuddering frame;
 And from her womb a lovely boy
 With wail and weeping came. 

Forth from her hair a silver pin
 With hasty hand she drew,
 And prest against its tender heart,
 And the sweet babe she slew. 

Erst when the act of blood was done,
 Her soul its guilt abhorr’d:
 ‘My Jesus! what has been my deed? 
Have mercy on me, Lord!’ 

With bloody nails, beside the pond,
 Its shallow grave she tore:
 ‘There rest in God – there shame and want
 Thou can’st not suffer more! 

Me vengeance waits! My poor, poor child,
 Thy wound shall bleed afresh,
 When ravens from the gallows tear
 Thy mother’s mould’ring flesh!’ 

Hard by the bower her gibbet stands;
 Her skull is still to show –
 It seems to eye the barren grave,
 Three spans in length below. 

That is the spot where grows no grass,
 Where falls no rain nor dew,
 Whence steals along the pond of toads
 A hovering fire so blue! 

And nightly, when the ravens come,
 Her ghost is seen to glide;
 Pursues and tries to quench the flame,
 And pines the pool beside.
