[Haiku]

Crumpling the briny shore into waste paper plovers fly

Boatman, don’t piss into the moon in the waves

A single mosquito stirs up a wind near my ear

A tired cormorant watches a cuckoo pass in the sky

At the Imperial Inn a snail acts as if it was all his

Kyoto in sight, I knead my shins in spring haze

Snail, are you delighted with the daybreak glow? 

A sparrow cries its birth cry into the azure sky

Against evening Fuji, asses side by side, frogs croak

I’ll show a cascade of piss to you, croaking frog

Look here, lice, crawl, crawl to where spring’s going

Through a hole in a mosquito column I see the City

vA praying mantis hangs from a temple bell with one arm

At the lightning a frog gives himself a pat on the head

Snail, carefully, slowly climb Mount Fuji
