On the Death of Priscilla Farmer

As o’er the dying embers oft I cower
 When my tired spirits rest, and my heart swells
 Lulled by domestic quiet, Memory dwells
 On that blest tide, when thou the evening hour
 Didst gladden. While upon the accustomed chair
 I look, it seems as if thou still wert there;
 Kirtled in snowy apron, thy dear knees,
 Propt on the fendered hearth, my fancy sees,
 O’er which – exchanging souls – we wont to bend! 
And as I lift my head, thy features send
 A cheering smile to me – but, in its flight
 O’er my rain-pelted sash, a blast of night
 Sweeps surlily! I start, and fain would creep
 To the bleak dwelling where thy cold limbs sleep!
