National Song

On your feet now, Hungary calls you! 
Now is the moment, nothing stalls you,
 Shall we be slaves or men set free
 That is the question, answer me! 
By all the gods of Hungary
 We hereby swear,
 That we the yoke of slavery
 No more shall wear. 

Slaves we have been to this hour,
 Our forefathers who fell from power
 Fell free and lived as free men will,
 On land that was their own to till,
 By all the gods of Hungary
 We hereby swear,
 That we the yoke of slavery
 No more shall wear. 

Whoever now his life begrudges
 Deserves his death with thieves and drudges,
 For setting his own worthless hide
 Above his country’s need and pride. 
By all the gods of Hungary
 We hereby swear,
 That we the yoke of slavery
 No more shall wear. 

The sword shines brighter than the fetters
 It is the finery of our betters,
 Of slaves and fetters we grow bored. 
Leap to my side, ancestral sword. 
By all the gods of Hungary
 We hereby swear,
 That we the yoke of slavery
 No more shall wear. 

Magyars, once more our name and story
 Shall match our ancestors’ in glory. 
The centuries of shame and hurt
 Can now be washed away like dirt. 
By all the gods of Hungary
 We hereby swear,
 That we the yoke of slavery
 No more shall wear. 

And wheresoever we may perish
 Grandchildren those graves shall cherish
 Singing our praises in their prayers
 To thank us that our names are theirs. 
By all the gods of Hungary
 We hereby swear,
 That we the yoke of slavery
 No more shall wear.
