She Sat Alone Beside Her Hearth

She sat alone beside her hearth –
 For many nights alone –
 She slept not on the pleasant couch
 Where fragrant herbs were strown. 

At first she bound her raven hair
 With feather and with shell –
 But then she hoped! – at length, like night,
 Around her neck it fell. 

They saw her wandering mid the woods,
 Lone, with the cheerless dawn,
 And then they said, ‘Can this be her
 We called the Startled Fawn?’ 

Her heart was in her large sad eyes,
 Half sunshine and half shade,
 And love – as love first springs to life –
 Of every thing afraid. 

The red leaf far more heavily
 Fell down to autumn earth
 Than her light feet, which seemed to move
 To music and to mirth. 

With the light feet of early youth,
 What hopes and joys depart –
 Ah, nothing like the heavy step
 Betrays the heavy heart. 

It is a usual history
 That Indian girl could tell:
 Fate sets apart one common doom
 For all who love too well. 

The proud, the shy, the sensitive –
 Life has not many such –
 They dearly buy their happiness,
 By feeling it too much. 

A stranger to her forest home,
 That fair young stranger came;
 They raised for him the funeral song –
 For him the funeral flame. 

Love sprang from pity, and her arms
 Around his arms she threw;
 She told her father, ‘If he dies,
 Your daughter dieth too!’ 

For her sweet sake they set him free –
 He lingered at her side;
 And many a native song yet tells
 Of that pale stranger’s bride. 

Two years have passed – how much two years
 Have taken in their flight! 
They’ve taken from the lip its smile,
 And from the eye its light. 

Poor child! – she was a child in years,
 So timid and so young –
 With what a fond and earnest faith
 To desperate hope she clung! 

His eyes grew cold, his voice grew strange
 They only grew more dear)
 She served him meekly, anxiously,
 With love – half faith, half fear. 

And can a fond and faithful heart
 Be worthless in those eyes
 For which it beats? Ah, woe to those
 Who such a heart despise! 

Poor child! what lonely days she passed,
 With nothing to recall
 But bitter taunts, and careless words,
 And looks more cold than all. 

Alas for love that sits at home,
 Forsaken, and yet fond –
 The grief that sits beside the hearth,
 Life has no grief beyond! 

He left her, but she followed him –
 She thought he could not bear,
 When she had left her home for him,
 To look on her despair. 

Adown the strange and mighty stream
 She took her lonely way:
 The stars at night her pilots were,
 As was the sun by day. 

Yet mournfully – how mournfully –
 The Indian looked behind
 When the last sound of voice or step
 Died on the midnight wind. 

Yet still adown the gloomy stream
 She plied her weary oar –
 Her husband, he had left their home,
 And it was home no more. 

She found him – but she found in vain –
 He spurned her from his side;
 He said her brow was all too dark
 For her to be his bride. 

She grasped his hands – her own were cold –
 And silent turned away,
 As she had not a tear to shed
 And not a word to say. 

And pale as death she reached her boat,
 And guided it along;
 With broken voice she strove to raise
 A melancholy song. 

None watched the lonely Indian girl –
 She passed unmarked of all –
 Until they saw her slight canoe
 Approach the mighty Fall! 

Upright within that slender boat
 They saw the pale girl stand,
 Her dark hair streaming far behind,
 Upraised her desperate hand. 

The air is filled with shriek and shout:
 They call, but call in vain! 
The boat amid the waters dashed –
 ’Twas never seen again.
