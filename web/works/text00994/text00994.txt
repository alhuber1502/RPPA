Ganymede

Why sleep, mountain son, lying askew, despondent,
Shivering on the bare streambank, all patience?
Not a thought for grace now, when once
Was thirst at the tables, among gods?

The father’s heralds, is there nothing of them you see
Down there? Sharper winds in the gully at play?
Or hear what he says, the much-traveled
Man filled with old spirit?

Nevertheless the music sounds in his heart. As then,
When high in the hills he slept, there is a gushing up,
But now the prisoner washes himself
Clean of his bonds, now he hurries,

Gauche, mocking the slag, seizes and breaks
And hurls the splinters now, drunk with wrath,
In play, hither and thither against
The watchful streambank, and the flocks

Rise to their feet at the special voice of the stranger,
Forests thrill, the plain below can hear
The far spirit of streams and the shuddering
Spirit thrills in earth’s navel again.

Spring comes. And each thing in its fashion
Breaks into flower. But he is gone, out of it,
He went awry; they are too generous,
The elementals; it is with gods now he speaks.
