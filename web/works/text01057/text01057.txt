The Grenadiers

To France were returning two grenadiers
From Russia where they had been taken.
And when they came to the German frontiers,
They hung down their heads forsaken.

There sadly they heard the people tell
How France had been shattered and shaken,
Her Grand Army smashed by shot and shell,
And the Emperor, the Emperor was taken.

Together they wept, the grenadiers,
The sorrowful story learning.
Said one: “Ah woe!” with trembling tears,
"Woe’s me, how my old wound is burning.”

The other said: “The play is done —
Cold death I’d gladly cherish;
But ah, I have a wife and son,
Without me they would perish.”

“Who cares for child? Who cares for wife?
In my breast deeper longings awaken;
Let them all go begging to save their life —
The Emperor, the Emperor is taken!

“O grant me, comrade, one request:
When I am dead, if you love me,
O take my corpse to France, to rest
With the soil of France above me.

“The Cross of Honor with crimson band
Lay on my breast to pride me,
Give me my musket in my hand,
And gird my sword beside me.

“Thus will I listen and lie evermore
In my grave like a sentry staying,
Till one day I hear the cannon’s roar
And horses trampling and neighing.

“That day will my Emperor ride over my grave,
Bright swords and lances attending,
That day will I rise fully armed from the grave,
The Emperor, the Emperor defending! "
