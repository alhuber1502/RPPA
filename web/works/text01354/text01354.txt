Venetian Epigrams

[I., LXVI., CVI., CXXXVII., CXLI., CXLIII., CLV.]

I.

Urns & sarcophagi
 pagans paint into life,
 dancing fauns,
 dancing bands of
 bacchantes, bright
 lines of them,
 goatfooted, fatcheeked,
 squeeze sounds
 hot & wild
 through brass horns,
 percussions & cymbals
 blare out,
 we see & hear
 on the marble,
 birds beating wings,
 sweet taste
 of the fruit
 on your beaks,
 no noise to frighten you off
 still less
 to drive away Eros
 who joins the bright crowds
 rejoicing,
 hoisting his torch. 
So bounty overcomes death
 & the ashes within
 in the house
 made of silence
 still find pleasure
 in life. 
Some day
 may the tomb of the poet
 be graced
 with this scroll
 he has richly bejewelled
 with life. 

LXVI.

Lots of things I can stomach. Most of what irks me
 I take in my stride, as a god might command me. 
But four things I hate more than poisons & vipers:
 tobacco smoke, garlic, bedbugs, and Christ. 

CVI.

Doesn’t surprise me that Christ our Lord
 preferred to live with whores
 & sinners, seeing
 I go in for that myself. 

CXXXVII.

what bothers me is this:
 the way Bettina gets to be so skillful
 every limb in her body
 grows looser & looser
 till she can stick her own little tongue
 up her own little cunt
 a charmer who tastes her own charms
 will soon lose all interest in men. 
Is it so big a mystery
 what god and man and world are? 
No! but nobody knows how to solve it
 so the mystery hangs on. 

CXLI.

Not schwanz meaning “tail”
 but some fancier word
 o Priapus
 me being a poet
 in German
 that word grinds me down. 
In Greek I can call you
 a phallos a marvelous
 sound to my ears
 and in Latin mentula
 from mens meaning “mind”
 another good word. 
But schwanz is something
 that sticks out from behind
 & behind isn’t where
 I find pleasure. 

CXLIII.

I could have made it just as well with boys
 although my thing has always been with girls. 
And once I get my satisfaction with a girl
 I can turn her around & have her as a boy. 

CLV.

Tight little alleyway — no room
 to squeeze between its walls —
 a young girl blocks my way,
 my rambles around Venice
 knocks me off my feet,
 the place, the come-on
 to a stranger’s eye,
 a wide canal my drifting
 takes me to. If you
 had girls like your canals,
 o Venice, cunts
 like little alleyways, you’d be
 the greatest city in the world.
