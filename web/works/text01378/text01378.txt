Is it the Night of Power ...

Is it the night of power
 Or only your hair? 
Is it dawn
 Or your face? 

In the songbook of beauty
 Is it a deathless first line
 Or only a fragment
 Copied from your inky eyebrow? 

Is it boxwood of the orchard
 Or cypress of the rose garden? 
The tuba tree of paradise, abundant with dates,
 Or your standing beautifully straight? 

Is it musk of a Chinese deer
 Or scent of delicate rosewater? 
The rose breathing in the wind
 Or your perfume? 

Is it scorching lightning
 Or light from fire on Sana’i Mountain? 
My hot sigh
 Or your inner radiance? 

Is it Mongolian musk
 Or pure ambergris? 
Is it your hyacinth curls
 Or your braids? 

Is it a glass of red wine at dawn
 Or white magic? 
Your drunken narcissus eye
 Or your spell? 

Is it the Garden of Eden
 Or heaven on earth? 
A mosque of the masters of the heart
 Or a back alley? 

Everyone faces a mosque of adobe and mud
 When they pray. 
The mosque of Hayati’s soul
 Turns to your face.
