I didn’t love her ...

I didn’t love her, I knew
she could not understand a poet;
her soul was deaf to the language of the soul .. „
What did I look for in her, mad that I was?
Why did I trumpet her praises in my poems
and pusillanimously sing
her empire and my sad captivity?
How could I lovingly entrust to her
my soul’s most cherished dreams
The mist has fallen from my eyes,
I run from her in horror!
There are such times when we are plunged by drink
in darkness, and we grasp a scoundrel’s hand
with the warm hand of friendship,
greet him with a beatific smile
and eloquently scatter
our inmost thoughts before him;
and though a dim awareness of our error haunts us,
it is in vain our overheated mind
attempts to rein in this demeaning folly.
Awakening, we wonder at our strange distraction,
ashamed of this unspeakable companion,
and shunning his repulsive face.
