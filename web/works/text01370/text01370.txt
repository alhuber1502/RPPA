Bitter Rain in my Courtyard ...

Bitter rain in my courtyard
 In the decline of Autumn,
 I only have vague poetic feelings
 That I cannot bring together. 
They diffuse into the dark clouds
 And the red leaves. 
After the yellow sunset
 The cold moon rises
 Out of the gloomy mist. 
I will not let down the blinds
 Of spotted bamboo from their silver hook. 
Tonight my dreams will follow the wind,
 Suffering the cold,
 To the jasper tower of your beautiful flesh.
