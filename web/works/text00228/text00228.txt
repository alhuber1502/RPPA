Lift Not the Painted Veil

Lift not the painted veil which those who live
 Call life! Though unreal shapes be pictured there,
 And it but mimic all we would believe
 With colours idly spread, behind, lurk Fear
 And Hope, twin destinies, who ever weave
 Their shadows o’er the chasm, sightless and drear. 
I knew one who had lifted it: he sought
 (For his lost heart was tender) things to love,
 But found them not, alas – nor was there aught
 The world contains, the which he could approve. 
Through the unheeding many he did move,
 A splendour among shadows, a bright blot
 Upon this gloomy scene, a spirit that strove
 For truth, and like the Preacher found it not.
