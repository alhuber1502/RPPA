Two April Mornings

We walked along while bright and red
 Uprose the morning sun,
 And Matthew stopped – he looked, and said
 ‘The will of God be done!’ 

A village schoolmaster was he
 With hair of glittering grey,
 As blithe a man as you could see
 On a spring holiday. 

And on that morning, through the grass
 And by the steaming rills,
 We travelled merrily to pass
 A day among the hills. 

‘Our work’, said I, ‘was well begun –
 Then, from thy breast what thought,
 Beneath so beautiful a sun,
 So sad a sigh has brought?’ 

A second time did Matthew stop
 And, fixing still his eye
 Upon the eastern mountain-top,
 To me he made reply:

‘Yon cloud with that long purple cleft
 Brings fresh into my mind
 A day like this which I have left
 Full thirty years behind. 

And on that slope of springing corn
 The self-same crimson hue
 Fell from the sky that April morn –
 The same which now I view. 

With rod and line my silent sport
 I plied by Derwent’s wave,
 And, coming to the church, stopped short
 Beside my daughter’s grave. 

Nine summers had she scarcely seen,
 The pride of all the vale! 
And then she sang – she would have been
 A very nightingale! 

Six feet in earth my Emma lay,
 And yet I loved her more
 (For so it seemed) than till that day
 I e’er had loved before. 

And, turning from her grave, I met
 Beside the churchyard-yew
 A blooming girl, whose hair was wet
 With points of morning dew. 

A basket on her head she bare,
 Her brow was smooth and white;
 To see a child so very fair,
 It was a pure delight! 

No fountain from its rocky cave
 E’er tripped with foot so free;
 She seemed as happy as a wave
 That dances on the sea. 

There came from me a sigh of pain
 Which I could ill confine;
 I looked at her, and looked again –
 And did not wish her mine.’ 

Matthew is in his grave, yet now
 Methinks I see him stand,
 As at that moment, with his bough
 Of wilding in his hand.
