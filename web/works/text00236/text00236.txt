Be Frank with Me

Be frank with me, and I accept my lot;
 But deal not with me as a grieving child,
 Who for the loss of that which he hath not
 Is by a show of kindness thus beguiled! 
Raise not for me, from its enshrouded tomb,
 The ghostly likeness of a hope deceased;
 Nor think to cheat the darkness of my doom
 By wavering doubts how far thou art released. 
This dressing pity in the garb of love,
 This effort of the heart to seem the same,
 These sighs and lingerings (which nothing prove
 But that thou leavest me with a kind of shame),
 Remind me more, by their most vain deceit,
 Of the dear loss of all which thou dost counterfeit.
