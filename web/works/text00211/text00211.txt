Nuns Fret Not

Nuns fret not at their convent’s narrow room,
 And hermits are contented with their cells,
 And students with their pensive citadels;
 Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,
 Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom
 High as the highest peak of Furness Fells
 Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells. 
In truth, the prison unto which we doom
 Ourselves, no prison is; and hence to me,
 In sundry moods, ’twas pastime to be bound
 Within the sonnet’s scanty plot of ground –
 Pleased if some souls (for such there needs must be)
 Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,
 Should find short solace there, as I have found.
