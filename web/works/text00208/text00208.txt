Milton, Thou Shouldst Be Living at this Hour

Milton, thou shouldst be living at this hour,
 England hath need of thee! She is a fen
 Of stagnant waters! Altar, sword, and pen,
 Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,
 Have forfeited their ancient English dower
 Of inward happiness. We are selfish men –
 Oh raise us up, return to us again,
 And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power! 
Thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart;
 Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea –
 Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free –
 So didst thou travel on life’s common way
 In cheerful godliness. And yet thy heart
 The lowliest duties on itself did lay.
