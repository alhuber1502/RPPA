At a Village in Scotland

[Sonnet VII.]

Oh North, as thy romantic vales I leave,
 And bid farewell to each retiring hill
 Where thoughtful fancy seems to linger still
 Tracing the broad bright landscape, much I grieve
 That (mingled with the toiling crowd) no more
 I shall return, your varied views to mark â€“
 Of rocks, amid the sunshine towering dark,
 Of rivers winding wild, and mountains hoar,
 Or castle gleaming on the distant steep. 
Yet not the less I pray your charms may last,
 And many a softened image of the past
 Pensive combine, and bid remembrance keep
 To cheer me with the thought of pleasure flown
 When I am wandering on my way alone.
