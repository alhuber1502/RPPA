All around a silencing ...

[Forest songs, 9]

All around a silencing and fading;
How softly breezes stroke the forest trees -
To coax them each to yield their withered leaves:
I love to watch this gently dying.

From here the quiet journey willing depart,
The time of love no longer echoes,
The birds have finished all their singing,
The shriveled leaves sink softly to the earth.

The birds have made their passage to the south;
While all the foliage is falling
Nests emerge that no more need its safety;
Leaves keep dropping that have lost their strength.

Amid this forestâ€™s gentle rustling
I seem to hear a message in the air:
This dying and this passing far away
Are silent, secret, joyous changing.
