Moonlight

The moon was serene and played upon the waves. —
Unlocked at last the window opens to the breeze,
The sultana gazes on dark isles below
Adorned with silver waves by breaking seas.

The guitar drops still humming from her hands.
She listens. A dull sound strikes beyond the shore.
Is it a laden Turkish boat coming from Cos,
Beating the Greek islands with its Tartar oar?

Are they cormorants that plummet one by one
And send the water pearling over their wings?
Or a djinn that throws battlements into the sea
From up in the tower while he shrieks and sings?

Who troubles the waters near the seraglio?
Neither black cormorants, rocking where they float,
Nor stones from the tower, nor the measured sound
Of the oars bringing to port a laden boat.

They are heavy sacks, and out of them come sobs.
You would see, if you watched them sink to their graves,
Something moving in their wombs like human forms ... —
The moon was serene and played upon the waves.
