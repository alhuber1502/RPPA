A Lamp in a Strong Wind

My wailing — oh inventor of torture — is just a mode of petition.
It’s really a request for more torture, and not a complaint.

Even though my house is destroyed, I recognize the value of open space.   
In the deliciousness of the desert I forget about home.

To the wise, a storm of difficulty maybe a school.
The slaps of waves resemble the slaps of a master.

Things have gone so far that she doesn’t even say hello.
If I complain to God, she knows my complaints have no effect.

Why are the roses and the tulips losing their elegant colors?
Maybe they recognize they are lamps in the path of a strong wind.

In the street where you live I see the splendor of Paradise.
But Paradise is not as crowded as your street.

Ghalib, which mouth are you using when you complain of your exile?
Have you forgotten the unkindness of people in your own city?
