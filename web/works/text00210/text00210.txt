Ere We Had Reached the Wished-for Place

Ere we had reached the wished-for place, night fell;
 We were too late at least by one dark hour,
 And nothing could we see of all that power
 Of prospect whereof many thousands tell. 
The western sky did recompense us well
 With Grecian temple, minaret, and bower,
 And in one part a minster with its tower
 Substantially distinct – a place for bell
 Or clock to toll from! Many a glorious pile
 Did we behold, sights that might well repay
 All disappointment – and, as such, the eye
 Delighted in them – but we felt, the while,
 We should forget them. They are of the sky
 And from our earthly memory fade away.
