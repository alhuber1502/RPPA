What is the freedom of dreams ...

What is the freedom of dreams to the prisoner? Look
at the uncomplaining river flowing on
between the appointed banks of its downhill course;
the fir-tree stands majestic where it grew tall
and has no power to move. The lamps of heaven
are drawn in their fixed ways by an unknown power.
The wandering wind is unfree. Its every breath
is subject to law. So let us also submit
to our lot without grumbling. Let us either tame
or forget our rebellious dreams with the wisdom of slaves,
obediently reconciling our desires
with our fate â€” and we shall live happy and calm.
Madmen! Are our passions not given to us
by a higher will? And do we not hear its voice
in their voice? Oh, heavily life weighs us down,
pulsing within our hearts like a raging wave
and confined by fate within its narrow bounds.
