On the Extinction of the Venetian Republic

Once did she hold the gorgeous East in fee,
 And was the safeguard of the West â€“ the worth
 Of Venice did not fall below her birth,
 Venice, the eldest child of Liberty! 
She was a maiden-city, bright and free,
 No guile seduced, no force could violate;
 And when she took unto herself a mate,

She must espouse the everlasting sea. 
And what if she had seen those glories fade,
 Those titles vanish, and that strength decay? 
Yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
 When her long life hath reached its final day:
 Men are we, and must grieve when even the shade
 Of that which once was great is passed away.
