To a Mountain Daisy,

 on Turning One Down with the Plough, April 1786

Wee, modest, crimson-tipp
                ed
               flower,
 Thou’s met me in an evil hour;
 For I maun crush amang the stoure
 Thy slender stem:
 To spare thee now is past my power,
 Thou bonnie gem. 

Alas! It’s no thy neebor sweet,
 The bonnie lark, companion meet,
 Bending thee ’mang the dewy weet,
 Wi’ spreckled breast,
 When upward-springing, blythe, to greet
 The purpling east. 

Cauld blew the bitter-biting north
 Upon thy early, humble birth;
 Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth
 Amid the storm,
 Scarce reared above the parent-earth
 Thy tender form. 

The flaunting flowers our gardens yield,
 High sheltering woods and wa’s maun shield;
 But thou, beneath the random bield
 O’ clod or stane,
 Adorns the histie stibble-field,
 Unseen, alane. 

There, in thy scanty mantle clad,
 Thy snawie bosom sun-ward spread,
 Thou lifts thy unassuming head
 In humble guise;
 But now the share uptears thy bed,
 And low thou lies! 

Such is the fate of artless maid,
 Sweet floweret of the rural shade,
 By love’s simplicity betrayed,
 And guileless trust;
 Till she, like thee, all soiled, is laid
 Low i’ the dust. 

Such is the fate of simple bard,
 On Life’s rough ocean luckless starred! 
Unskilful he to note the card
 Of prudent lore,
 Till billows rage, and gales blow hard,
 And whelm him o’er! 

Such fate to suffering Worth is given,
 Who long with wants and woes has striven,
 By human pride or cunning driven
 To misery’s brink;
 Till, wrenched of every stay but Heaven,
 He, ruined, sink! 

Even thou who mournst the Daisy’s fate,
 That fate is thine – no distant date –
 Stern Ruin’s plough-share drives elate,
 Full on thy bloom,
 Till crushed beneath the furrow’s weight
 Shall be thy doom!
