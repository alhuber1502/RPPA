Spin Love

Spin love, spin love out of your heart
 As from the worm the silk is wound,
 As from the spring the waters start,
 As flows the river underground. 
Unroll love like those glittering sheets,
 Papyrus-thin, and bright with glamour,
 Which patiently the goldsmith beats
 Out of an ingot with a hammer. 
And blow love as the zephyr blows,
 Upward and outward, far and wide,
 And cast it as the farmer sows
 The prodigal grain on every side. 
Love men and women everywhere,
 All human creatures brought to birth,
 As mothers for their children care. 

Your hands will have more power on earth
 Than nature has; and then your strength,
 Indomitable, shall equate
 That of the elements, and at, length,
 Shall be the power to propagate,
 Then be the power of the people,
 Then power of a heavenly horde
 Of angels flying round a steeple â€“
 At last, the power of the Lord.
