A white nymph wandering in the woods by night ...

A white nymph wandering in the woods by night
 â€¨ Spies a swift satyr, and pretends a flight;
 She runs, and, running, feigns to call him back! 
The goat-foot, following on her flying track,
 Falls down and flounders in the stagnant pool:
 Whereat they, while he whimpers, mock the fool.
