Europe, A Prophecy

[Preface]

‘Five windows light the caverned man: through one he breathes the air;
 Through one, hears music of the spheres; through one, the eternal vine
 Flourishes, that he may receive the grapes; through one, can look
 And see small portions of the eternal world that ever groweth;
 Through one, himself pass out what time he please (but he will not,
 For stolen joys are sweet, and bread eaten in secret pleasant).’ 

So sang a fairy, mocking, as he sat on a streaked tulip
 Thinking none saw him. When he ceased I started from the trees
 And caught him in my hat, as boys knock down a butterfly. 
‘How know you this’, said I, ‘small sir? Where did you learn this song?’ 
Seeing himself in my possession, thus he answered me:
 ‘My master, I am yours! Command me, for I must obey.’ 

‘Then tell me, what is the material world – and is it dead?’ 
He laughing answered: ‘I will write a book on leaves of flowers,
 If you will feed me on love-thoughts, and give me now and then
 A cup of sparkling poetic fancies. So, when I am tipsy
 I’ll sing to you to this soft lute, and show you all alive
 The world, where every particle of dust breathes forth its joy.’ 

I took him home in my warm bosom: as we went along
 Wild flowers I gathered, and he showed me each eternal flower. 
He laughed aloud to see them whimper because they were plucked –
 They hovered round me like a cloud of incense. When I came
 Into my parlour and sat down, and took my pen to write,
 My fairy sat upon the table, and dictated Europe.
