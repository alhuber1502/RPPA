Where Be Ye Going

Where be ye going, you Devon maid? 
And what have you there in the basket? 
Ye tight little fairy, just fresh from the dairy,
 Will ye give me some cream if I ask it? 

I love your meads, and I love your flowers,
 And I love your junkets mainly,
 But ‘hind the door I love kissing more,
 Oh look not so disdainly! 

I love your hills and I love your dales,
 And I love your flocks a-bleating –
 But oh, on the heather to lie together
 With both our hearts a-beating! 

I’ll put your basket all safe in a nook,
 Your shawl I hang on this willow,
 And we will sigh in the daisy’s eye
 And kiss on a grass-green pillow.
