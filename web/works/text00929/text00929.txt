The Akkerman Steppes

As though it were the dried up bed of a sea
An ocean of green surrounds the cart, lulled like a boat
Among waves of meadowsweet, flowers confused by the breeze.
I drift among spurs and bluffs of vivid growth

When the darkness comes, obscuring earthworks and roads.
Scanning the stars, I hunt for a guide in the east
Among roaming clouds, where the evening star greets
The shining Dniester, and all the lamps of Akkerman glow.

When we stop, it is stiller than still. I catch the trailing flight
Of the cranes, escaping even the falconâ€™s eye,
And I hear the grass bend where the moths alight

And the slithering of snakes among clover and thyme.
I strain to detect in the absolute quiet
The voices of home. But there is no answering cry.
