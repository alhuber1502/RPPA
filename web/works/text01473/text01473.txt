Dans L’Allee

As in the age of shepherd king and queen,
 Painted and frail amid her nodding bows,
 Under the somber branches, and between   
The green and mossy garden-ways she goes,
 With little mincing airs one keeps to pet   
A dariing and provoking perroquet. 
Her long-trained robe is blue, the fan she holds   
With fluent fingers girt with heavy rings,
 So vaguely hints of vague erotic things   
That her eye smiles, musing among its folds. 
— Blonde too, a tiny nose, a rosy mouth,
 Artful as that sly patch that makes more sly,
 In her divine unconscious pride of youth,
 The slightly simpering sparkle of the eye.
