An Island in the Moon

[Song XII. Village Cricket]

Oh I say, you Joe,
 Throw us the ball! 
I’ve a good mind to go
 And leave you all. 
I never saw such a bowler –
 To bowl the ball in a tansey,
 And to clean it with my handkercher
 Without saying a word! 

That Bill’s a foolish fellow –
 He has given me a black eye! 
He does not know how to handle a bat
 Any more than a dog or a cat:
 He has knocked down the wicket
 And broke the stumps,
 And runs without shoes to save his pumps!
