Miracle of Love

Love may be sought, love may be found,
But love is never taught or learned.
Whoever wants to light its flame
And by its fire not be burned
Must be free of sin and blame.
While all are sleeping heâ€™s awake;
The star of love will smile its light,
And golden eyes all gaze at him;
Drunk with rapture he looks up
At the magic moonlit night.

But he must never feel afraid
When darkness covers up the stars,
And black clouds race across the sky,
And the moon still hardly dares
Send a glimmer to his eye.
The canopy of love will stand
And shine with its own inner light;
Only courage can unbind
What makes us falter and take fright:
The fear that manacles the mind.

No one has discovered love
Who lives a life of solemn gloom;
Fleeting is the golden hour,
Never coming once to him
Whom Care keeps within her power:
Whoever cherishes a snake,
Him the shadow will appall;
Every song the poets sing
The poor imprisoned man will call
A fantastic foolish thing.

The heart, when flowering in faith,
Feels at once each golden beam,
And drawing them into itself
Makes them lovingly its own
Glowing in a lovely flame.
Once the sacrifice is lit
It is offered to the skies;
If love accepts your faithful heart
On the altar burning bright,
Then in your ancient splendor rise.
