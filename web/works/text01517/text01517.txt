It is a long time since my love stayed   with me here ...

It is a long time since my love stayed with me here
And the sparkling goblet lit up our evening together.

Again my complaining breath comes hot, showering sparks.   
It is a long time since we saw the night filled with flares.

Again the old enemies, heart and eye, come together
  Pining for chances to see her, to brood upon her.

Again I long for her to appear on her balcony,  
the wind veiling her face in her black hair.

Again the heart yearns for free days and nights, as before,
to think of nothing and no one but her.
