Stanzas to Augusta

When all around grew drear and dark,
 And reason half withheld her ray,
 And hope but shed a dying spark
 Which more misled my lonely way –

In that deep midnight of the mind,
 And that internal strife of heart,
 When, dreading to be deemed too kind,
 The weak despair – the cold depart! 

When Fortune changed, and Love fled far,
 And Hatred’s shafts flew thick and fast,
 Thou wert the solitary star
 Which rose and set not to the last. 

Oh, blest be thine unbroken light! 
That watched me as a seraph’s eye,
 And stood between me and the night,
 For ever shining sweetly nigh. 

And when the cloud upon us came,
 Which strove to blacken o’er thy ray –
 Then purer spread its gentle flame,
 And dashed the darkness all away! 

Still may thy spirit dwell on mine,
 And teach it what to brave or brook:
 There’s more in one soft word of thine
 Than in the world’s defied rebuke. 

Thou stoodst as stands a lovely tree,
 That still unbroke, though gently bent,
 Still waves with fond fidelity
 Its boughs above a monument. 

The winds might rend, the skies might pour,
 But there thou wert – and still wouldst be
 Devoted in the stormiest hour
 To shed thy weeping leaves o’er me. 

But thou and thine shall know no blight,
 Whatever fate on me may fall;
 For Heaven in sunshine will requite
 The kind – and thee the most of all! 

Then let the ties of baffled love
 Be broken – thine will never break! 
Thy heart can feel, but will not move;
 Thy soul, though soft, will never shake. 

And these, when all was lost beside,
 Were found and still are fixed, in thee –
 And bearing still a breast so tried,
 Earth is no desert – e’en to me!
