Pan Tadeusz

[Book I, excerpt ‘Gospodarstwo’]

O Lithuania, my country, thou
 Art like good health; I never knew till now
 How precious, till I lost thee. Now I see
 Thy beauty whole, because I yearn for thee. 

O Holy Maid, who Częstochowa’s shrine
 Dost guard and on the Pointed Gateway shine
 And watchest Nowogródek’s pinnacle! 
As Thou didst heal me by a miracle
 (For when my weeping mother sought Thy power,
 I raised my dying eyes, and in that hour
 My strength returned, and to Thy shrine I trod
 For life restored to offer thanks to God),
 So by a miracle Thou’lt bring us home. 
Meanwhile, bear off my yearning soul to roam
 Those little wooded hills, those fields beside
 The azure Niemen, spreading green and wide,
 The vari-painted cornfields like a quilt,
 The silver of the rye, the wheatfields’ gilt;
 Where amber trefoil, buck-wheat white as snow,
 And clover with her maiden blushes grow,
 And all is girdled with a grassy band
 Of green, whereon the silent pear trees stand. 
Such were the fields where once beside a rill
 Among the birch trees on a little hill
 There stood a manor house, wood-built on stone;
 From far away the walls with whitewash shone,
 The whiter as relieved by the dark green
 Of poplars, that the autumn winds would screen. 
It was not large, but neat in every way,
 And had a mighty barn; three stacks of hay
 Stood near it, that the thatch could not contain;
 The neighbourhood was clearly rich in grain;
 And from the stooks that every cornfield filled
 As thick as stars, and from the ploughs that tilled
 The black-earthed fields of fallow, broad and long,
 Which surely to the manor must belong,
 Like well-kept flower beds – everyone could tell
 That plenty in that house and order dwell. 
The gate wide open to the world declared
 A hospitable house to all who feared.
