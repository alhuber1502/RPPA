The happiness of the drop is to die   in the river ...

The happiness of the drop is to die in the river;
When the pain exceeds bearable limits, the pain itself becomes the medicine.

Our weakness is such that tears have turned into mere sighing.
Now we really believe that water can turn into air.

When the spring cloud clears after heavy rain, it seems to me as if it were
Weeping so hard that, at the end it simply dies (from excess of grief).

So that you may begin to understand the miracle of the altering / polishing winds,
  You should see how the mirror becomes green in spring,

The appearance of the rose has vouchsafed us the desire to witness (and enjoy),   Ghalib!
Whatever the color and condition of things, the eyes should always be open.
