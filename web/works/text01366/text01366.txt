Weaving at Night

Lampwick turned up, the room glows white. 
The loom moves easily all night long
 as feet work and push below. 
Nimbly the shuttle flies in and out,
 wide or narrow, big or small, sliding in snug. 
Long or short, it glides out smoothly. 
Girls who do it right, let it soak
 then wait a while for the blush to show.
