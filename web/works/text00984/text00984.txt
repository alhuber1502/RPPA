Chamouny at Sunrise

After Klopstock (in May 1791).

From the deep shadow of the silent pine grove
Trembling I behold thee, peak of Eternity;
Dazzling summit, dimly guessing at your height
My spirit soars into the infinite!

Who sank the pillar deep into the earth’s lap,
Which firmly for millennia upheld your mass?
Who piled up high into the ether’s vault
Mighty and bold your radiant countenance?

Who poured you down here with peals of thunder,
O jagged streams, high out of endless winter’s realm?
And who commanded, loud with omnipotent voice:
“Here the stiffening waves shall come to rest”?

Who points out the path there to the morning star?
Who wreathes with flowers the skirt of eternal frost?
To whom sounds in terrifying harmonies
Your tumult of torrents, O wild Arveiron?

Jehovah! Jehovah! It crashes in bursting ice;
Avalanche thunder rolls it down the chasm;
Jehovah! rustles in the bright tree tops,
And whispers in rippling silver brooks.
