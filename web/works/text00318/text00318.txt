To Mary

The twentieth year is well-nigh past
 Since first our sky was overcast –
 Ah would that this might be the last,
 My Mary! 

Thy spirits have a fainter flow,
 I see thee daily weaker grow –
 ’Twas my distress that brought thee low,
 My Mary. 

Thy needles, once a shining store
 For my sake restless heretofore),
 Now rust disused, and shine no more,
 My Mary! 

For though thou gladly wouldst fulfil
 The same kind office for me still,
 Thy sight now seconds not thy will,
 My Mary. 

But well thou playedst the housewife’s part,
 And all thy threads with magic art
 Have wound themselves about this heart,
 My Mary. 

Thy indistinct expressions seem
 Like language uttered in a dream;
 Yet me they charm, whate’er the theme,
 My Mary. 

Thy silver locks, once auburn bright,
 Are still more lovely in my sight
 Than golden beams of orient light,
 My Mary! 

For could I view nor them, nor thee,
 What sight worth seeing could I see? 
The sun would rise in vain for me,
 My Mary! 

Partakers of the sad decline,
 Thy hands their little force resign;
 Yet, gently prest, press gently mine,
 My Mary. 

And then I feel that still I hold
 A richer store ten-thousandfold
 Than misers fancy in their gold,
 My Mary! 

Such feebleness of limbs thou prov’st
 That now, at every step, thou mov’st
 Upheld by two! But still thou lov’st,
 My Mary. 

And still to love, though prest with ill,
 In wintry age to feel no chill,
 With me is to be lovely still,
 My Mary. 

But ah, by constant heed I know
 How oft the sadness that I show
 Transforms thy smiles to looks of woe,
 My Mary! 

And should my future lot be cast
 With much resemblance to the past,
 Thy worn-out heart will break at last,
 My Mary!
