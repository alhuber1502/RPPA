To the Poet

Poet, you must not prize the people’s love;
Its praises are not heard beyond the moment.
Be always tranquil, steadfast and aloof;
Hear both the fool and public’s heartless merriment.

You are a tsar: live, then, alone. And walk
At will the open highway of ideas,
Perfect the fruits your free mind cherishes,
And for a masterpiece seek no reward.

It is in yourself. You are your highest critic;
You judge your work more strictly than the rest.
Exacting artist, are you contented with it?

Are you? Then let the rabble raise its fist,
Spit on the flame that burns upon your altar,
And shake the tripod in its childish tantrum.
