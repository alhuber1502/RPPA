Ariadne on Naxos

Abandoned on the rocks of Naxos, Minos’ daughter weeps.
The fervent prayer of beauty rises to the gods.
From his throne the son of Cronus sends his lightnings down,
To draw her up in storms to immortality.

Poseidon now, with love aflame, has opened wide his arms,
Wishing to embrace her in the darkness of his waves.
Now to immortality shall Minos’ daughter mount?
Or shall she like the shades go down to Orcus’ gloom?

Ariadne waits no more to plunge into the sea:
It shall not be immortal, this pain of love betrayed!
Misery must not afflict the god-bereft above,,
Her heart’s deep wound will hide itself in the grave’s dark night.
