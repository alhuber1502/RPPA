On a Lamp

Not yet disturbed, O lovely lamp, you still adorn,
Gracefully suspended here on slender chains,
The ceiling of this pleasance, near-forgotten now.
On your white marble bowl, around whose rim is twined
A wreath of ivy leaves in greenish golden bronze,
Children happily join to dance a roundelay.
What charm throughout! Laughing, yet the whole form
Ringed by a gentle flowing spirit of seriousness.
A work of art, the genuine thing. Who notices it?
Yet blithely beauty seems to shine in self-content.
