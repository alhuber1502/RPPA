An Admission

Do not demand false tenderness from me,
I don’t hide the sad coldness of my heart.
Yes, it no longer burns with the fine flame
Of love I felt in the beginning.
In vain I summoned to my memory
Your beautiful appearance, my old dreams:
My memories are devoid of life,
I swore an oath, but cannot keep it.

I am not the servant of another beauty,
Drive from your heart the dreams of jealousy;
But I have been long years apart from you,
And in life’s storms my soul has grown distracted.
In it you came to seem a fleeting shadow;
I sighed for you less often, less sincerely,
And my flame, gradually dwindling,
Has gone out of its own accord.
Believe me, I am sad alone. The soul
Wants love. But I shall never love again;
Never forget myself: only first love
Can bring us that sweet ecstasy.

I grieve; but grief will pass, and this will be
Destiny’s final triumph over me;
Who knows? I’ll come to share the crowd’s opinion;
And without love — who knows? — I’ll choose a partner,
Give her my hand to seal a match of reason
And stand beside her in the temple
As she, perhaps, all innocent, dreams sweetly,
And I shall call her mine;
And you will hear of it; but do not envy us:
We shall not share between us secret thoughts
Nor let our dearest wishes have their way,
Our hearts will not be wedded at the altar,
Only our destinies will be united.
Farewell! For years we followed the same road;
Now I have taken a new one, be like me;
Let reason dull the edge of pointless sorrow,
And don’t, I pray you, vainly argue with me.
We cannot choose what we shall be
And in our youthful days
Make hasty vows, that seem, who knows,
Ridiculous to all-seeing fate.
