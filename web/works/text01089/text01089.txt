At Midnight

Night has calmly come to land,
And leans in dreams on mountain walls;
Her eyes now see Time’s golden balance
Resting silently in even scales;
But the springs more boldly babble out:
They sing in the ear of Mother Night
Of the day
Of the day that has been today.

The old, the ancient lullaby,
She’s sick of it, she hardly hears;
The heavens’ blue sounds sweeter to her still,
The round and even yoke of fleeting hours.
But the springs will always have their say,
The sleeping waters still sing away
Of the day
Of the day that has been today.
