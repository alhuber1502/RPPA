Sorrow

I’ve lost my friends, my gaiety,
Life itself and life’s energy;
I’ve lost even the pride that led
People to think me talented.

When I started to comprehend
The Truth, I thought it was a friend;
But when I grasped it through and through,
I was repelled by what I knew.

Yet Truth is never-wavering;
Those who have simply passed it by
In this world have missed everything.

When the Lord speaks, we must reply.
The sole good thing left on earth here
Is that I sometimes shed a tear.
