The Organ

Christ’s churches are wide open night and day;
But the vaults are alone, the flocks away;
The blue marble is dank with corpses; we
Have all forgotten how to bow the knee.
Strangers come only to see works of art;
Only a painter now stands, hand on heart,
Gazing in rapture at each pictured saint,
Piously worshipping the use of paint;
The faithless Church — that sad stone skeleton
Whose soul used to be prayer in days now gone —
The Church still has one precious benefit:
The priests of art still come and pray for it.
