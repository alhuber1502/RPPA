Rhyme

The dark swallows will return to your balcony to hang their nests and, once again, will playfully tap with their wings your window panes; but those who paused in their flight to contemplate your beauty and my happiness, they ... will not return! The dense honeysuckles in your garden will return to climb the walls and, once again, in the afternoon, even more beautiful, they will open their flowers; but those coated with dew whose droplets we watched as they trembled and fell like the tears of the day ... they ... will not return! The ardent words of love will return to sound in your ear; your heart will perhaps awaken from its profound dream; but, dumb and absorbed and on my knees as if worshipping a God before the altar, as I have loved you ... be not deceived: in that way ... they will not love you!
