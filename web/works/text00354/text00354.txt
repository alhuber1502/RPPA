I Am a Bard

I am a bard of no regard
 Wi’ gentle folks an’ a’ that,
 But Homer-like the glowran byke
 Frae town to town I draw that! 

For a’ that, an’ a’ that,
 And twice as muckle’s a’ that,
 I’ve lost but ane, I’ve twa behin’ –
 I’ve wife eneugh for a’ that! 

I never drank the Muses’ stank,
 Castalia’s burn, an a’ that,
 But there is streams, an’ richly reams –
 My Helicon I ca’ that! 

Great love I bear to a’ the fair,
 Their humble slave, an’ a’ that –
 But lordly will, I hold it still
 A mortal sin to thraw that! 

In raptures sweet this hour we meet,
 Wi’ mutual love an’ a’ that,
 But for how lang the flie may stang,
 Let inclination law that! 

Their tricks an’ craft hae put me daft,
 They’ve ta’en me in an’ a’ that,
 But clear your decks, and here’s – ‘The Sex!’ 
I like the jades for a’ that! 

For ‘a that, an’ a’ that,
 An’ twice as muckle as a’ that,
 My dearest bluid to do them guid,
 They’re welcome till’t for a’ that!
