To himself

Now you will rest forever
 My weary heart. The extreme deceit perished
 That I thought myself eternal. Perished. I truly feel
 Not the hope, but the desire in us
 For dear deceits, is dead. 
Left forever. Much
 You throbbed. Worthless your impulses,
 Undeserving of sighs
 Is the earth. Bitter and burdensome
 Is life, never anything else and the world is mud. 
Now be calm. Despair
 A final time. To our people fate
 Gave only death. Now despise
 Yourself, nature, the ugly
 Power which, hidden, stands over common damage
 And the infinite futility of all.
