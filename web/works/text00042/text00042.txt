The Task

[Book I, ll. 534 – 556: ‘Crazy Kate’]

There often wanders one, whom better days
 Saw better clad, in cloak of satin trimmed
 With lace, and hat with splendid ribband bound. 
A serving-maid was she, and fell in love
 With one who left her, went to sea and died. 
Her fancy followed him through foaming waves
 To distant shores, and she would sit and weep
 At what a sailor suffers; fancy too,
 Delusive most where warmest wishes are,
 Would oft anticipate his glad return,
 And dream of transports she was not to know. 
She heard the doleful tidings of his death,
 And never smiled again. And now she roams
 The dreary waste – there spends the livelong day,
 And there (unless when charity forbids)
 The livelong night. A tattered apron hides,
 Worn as a cloak – and hardly hides – a gown
 More tattered still! And both but ill conceal
 A bosom heaved with never-ceasing sighs. 
She begs an idle pin of all she meets,
 And hoards them in her sleeve; but needful food,
 Though pressed with hunger oft, or comelier clothes,
 Though pinched with cold, asks never – Kate is crazed.
