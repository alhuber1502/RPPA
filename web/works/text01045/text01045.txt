Moonlit Night

It seemed as if the heaven
In silence kissed the earth,
That she would have to see him
In blossom-shimmer dream.

The breeze went through the meadows
The grain-ears gently waved,
The forest rustled softly,
So star-clear was the night.

And now my soul expanded,
Spreading wide its wings;
It flew through silent farmlands
As if it flew toward home.
