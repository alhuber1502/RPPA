Frithiof’s Farewell

[From Canto XX]

“No more shall I see   
In its upward motion
   The smoke of the Northland. Man is a slave;   
The Fates decree. 
On the waste of the ocean,
 There is my fatherland, there is my grave. 

“Go not to the strand,
 Ring, with thy bride,
 After the stars spread their light through the sky,   
Perhaps in the sand,
 Washed up by the tide,
 The bones of the outlawed Viking may lie. 

“Then quoth the king,
 ‘’T is mournful to hear   
A man like a whimpering maiden cry,
 The death-song they sing
   Even now in mine ear. 
What avails it? He who is born must die.’”
