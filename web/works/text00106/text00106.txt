Song

(‘It was upon a Lammas Night’)

It was upon a Lammas night
 When corn rigs are bonnie,
 Beneath the moon’s unclouded light,
 I held awa to Annie;
 The time flew by wi’ tentless heed,
 Till, ’tween the late and early,
 Wi’ sma’ persuasion she agreed,
 To see me thro’ the barley. 

Corn rigs, an’ barley rigs,
 An’ corn rigs are bonnie
 I’ll ne’er forget that happy night,
 Amang the rigs wi’ Annie! 

The sky was blue, the wind was still,
 The moon was shining clearly,
 I set her down, wi’ right good will,
 Amang the rigs o’ barley. 
I ken’t her heart was a’ my ain,
 I loved her most sincerely,
 I kissed her owre and owre again
 Amang the rigs o’ barley. 

Corn rigs, an’ barley rigs,
 An’ corn rigs are bonnie
 I’ll ne’er forget that happy night,
 Amang the rigs wi’ Annie! 

I locked her in my fond embrace
 (Her heart was beating rarely),
 My blessings on that happy place
 Amang the rigs o’ barley –
 But by the moon and stars so bright,
 She ay shall bless that happy night,
 Amang the rigs o’ barley! 

Corn rigs, an’ barley rigs,
 An’ corn rigs are bonnie
 I’ll ne’er forget that happy night,
 Amang the rigs wi’ Annie! 

I hae been blythe wi’ comrades dear,
 I hae been merry drinking,
 I hae been joyfu’ gath’rin gear,
 I hae been happy thinking –
 But a’ the pleasures e’er I saw,
 Tho’ three times doubl’d fairly,
 That happy night was worth them a’,
 Amang the rigs o’ barley. 

Corn rigs, an’ barley rigs,
 An’ corn rigs are bonnie
 I’ll ne’er forget that happy night,
 Amang the rigs wi’ Annie!
