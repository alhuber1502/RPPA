Since flowering May is calling us outside ...

Since flowering May is calling us outside,
Come out! and blend it all deep in your heart —
The outspread moonlight by the drowsing tide,
The paths that finish where the highways start,
The pleasant glades, the forests, and the skies,
The land, the springtime, and the limitless
Horizon like a kiss our Earth applies
Devoutly to the hem of Heaven’s dress!
Come out! and let the modest stars, whose eyes
Look down on earth behind so many veils,
Let the trees steeped in birdsong and perfume,
The searing breath of midday in the dales,
The grass, the sea, the sunshine and the gloom,
The radiance of Nature’s every part —
Let them all open, like a double blfoom,
Loveliness on your trow, love in your heart!
