Written on Visiting a Scene in Argyleshire

At the silence of twilight’s contemplative hour
 I have mused in a sorrowful mood
 On the wind-shaken reeds that embosom the bower
 Where the home of my forefathers stood. 
All ruined and wild is their roofless abode,
 And lonely the dark raven’s sheltering tree –
 And travelled by few is the grass-covered road
 Where the hunter of deer and the warrior trod
 To his hills that encircle the sea. 

Yet, wandering, I found on my ruinous walk,
 By the dial-stone ag
                ed
               and green,
 One rose of the wilderness left on its stalk
 To mark where a garden had been. 
Like a brotherless hermit, the last of his race,
 All wild in the silence of Nature it drew
 From each wandering sunbeam a lonely embrace –
 For the night-weed and thorn overshadowed the place
 Where the flower of my forefathers grew. 

Sweet bud of the wilderness, emblem of all
 That remains in this desolate heart! 
The fabric of bliss to its centre may fall,
 But patience shall never depart
 Though the wilds of enchantment, all vernal and bright
 In the days of delusion, by fancy combined
 With the vanishing phantoms of love and delight,
 Abandon my soul like a dream of the night
 And leave but a desert behind. 

Be hushed, my dark spirit, for wisdom condemns
 When the faint and the feeble deplore –
 Be strong as the rock of the ocean, that stems
 A thousand wild waves on the shore! 
Through the perils of chance and the scowl of disdain
 May thy front be unaltered, thy courage elate! 
Yea, even the name I have worshipped in vain
 Shall awake not the sigh of remembrance again:
 To bear is to conquer our fate.
