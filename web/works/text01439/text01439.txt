Songs of the People

[excerpts]

1

Two steps from my garden rail   
Sleeps my well beneath its pail:
 Every sabbath comes my love
   And I let him drink thereof. 

All the world is sleeping now   
Like the fruit beneath the bough. 
Father, mother, both are gone   
And my heart wakes here alone. 

And the pail awakes with me,
 Dripping, dripping, drowsily:
 Drops of gold and crystal clear ...
   And my love is drawing near. 

Hiit! I think that something stirred;
 Was it he, or but a bird? 
Dearest friend, my lover dear,
 There is no one with me here. 

By the trough we sit and speak,
 Hand in hand and cheek to cheek;
 Hear this riddle: Can you tell   
Why the pitcher seeks the well? 

That you cannot answer, nor   
What the pail is weeping for? 
Morn to even, drop by drop,
 Fall its tears and cannot stop. 

This then tell me, why my breast   
Daylong, nightlong is oppressed. 
Spoke my mother truth in saying   
That your heart from me was straying? 

And my lover answered: See,
 Enemies have slandered me. 
Ere another year be gone,
 We shall marry, foolish one. 

On that golden day of days   
Shall the summer be ablaze. 
Fruited branches overhead   
Shall in benediction spread. 

Friend and kinsman, young and old   
Shall be gathered to behold,
 And with music and with mirth   
They shall come to lead us forth. 

And the bridal canopy   
In this place shall lifted be. 
I shall slip a ring of gold
   On this finger that I hold. 

And pronounce the blessing: “Thee   
God makes consecrate to me.” 
And my enemies shall there
   Burst with envy and despair.

On a hill there blooms a palm   
’Twixt Tigris and Euphrates old,
 And among the leafy branches
   Sits the phoenix, bird of gold. 

Bird of gold, go forth and find me   
Him whose bride I am to be:
 Search and circle till thou find him,   
Bind him, bring him, bird, to me. 

If thou hast no thread of scarlet,
 Give him greeting without end:
 Tell him, golden bird, my spirit   
Languishes towards my friend. 

Tell him: Now the garden blossoms,
   Closed except to his command;
 Mid the leaves the golden apple
   Waits and trembles for his hand. 

Tell him, nightly on my pillow   
Wakes the longing without name,
 And the whiteness of my body
   Burns my couch as with a flame. 

If he comes not, hear my secret:
 All prepared my coffer stands;
 Linen, silk, and twenty singlets   
Wrought and knitted by these hands. 

And the softest of all feathers   
By my mother plucked and stored:   
Through the nights she filled the cushions
   For her daughter’s bridal hoard. 

And the bridal veil of silver   
Waits to deck me when I marry:
 Bride and dowry, both are ready —
   Wherefore does the bridegroom tarry? 

Seethe and whisper, magic potion:
 Thus the phoenix makes reply:
 “In the night to thy beloved   
With my secret will I fly. 

“In his dreams I give thy greeting,
 In his dreams reveal thy face:
 Lo! Upon a broomstick mounted   
Unto thee he flies apace. 

“And he comes and speaks;
 ‘Behold me,   Oh, my joy, my hope, my pride:
 Not with golden gifts or dowry,
 But with love become my bride. 

“‘Gold and silk I have aplenty —
 Fire of youth and ringlets fine:
 Both I give thee — swiftly, lightly,
 Come to me, beloved mine.’” 

When the night was dark above me   
And the stars with clouds were stilled,
 On his quest the phoenix vanished —
 And his words are unfulfilled. 

And at morn, at noon, at even,
 Still I watch the clouds of fire:
 “Clouds above me, answer, Wherefore   
Comes he not, my heart’s desire?”
