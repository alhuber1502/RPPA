To Louisa Martin, Whom I Used to Call ‘Monkey’

Louisa, serious grown and mild,
 I knew you once a romping child,
 Obstreperous much and very wild. 
Then you would clamber up my knees,
 And strive with every art to tease,
 When every art of yours could please. 
Those things would scarce be proper now. 
But they are gone, I know not how,
 And woman’s written on your brow. 
Time draws his finger o’er the scene,
 But I cannot forget between
 The thing to me you once have been:
 Each sportive sally, wild escape –
 The scoff, the banter, and the jape –
 And antics of my gamesome Ape.
