You wake, O Baia ...

You wake, O Baia, from the tomb
With the first coming of Auroraâ€™s rays,
But rosy dawn will not return to you
The radiance of vanished days.
She will not bring again the cool retreats
Where swarms of beauties played,
And never will your porphyry colonnades
Rise from the depth of the blue waves.
