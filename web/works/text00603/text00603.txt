The Djinns

Walls, town,
 And port,
 Asylum
 Of death,
 Gray sea
 Where breaks
 The breeze,
 All sleeps. 
In the plain
 Is born a noise. 
It’s the breath
 Of the night
 It bawls
 Like a soul
 That a flame
 Always follows! 
The highest voice
 Seems a sleigh bell. 
Of a jumping dwarf
 It’s the gallop. 
It flees, rushes,
 Then in cadence
 On one foot dances
 At the tip of a wave. 
The hum approaches. 
The echo repeats it. 
It is like the bell
 Of a cursed convent;
 Like a crowd’s noise
 Booming and rolling,
 Now collapsing,
 Now growing,
 God! the sepulchral voice
 Of the Djinns! ... What a noise! 
Let’s flee under the spiral
 Of the deep staircase. 
Already my lamp goes out,
 And the shadow of the ramp,
 Which slithers across the wall,
 Climbs up to the ceiling. 
The swarm of Djinns is passing
 And swirls around while whistling! 
The yews, which their flight smashes,
 Crackle like a burning pine. 
Their herd, heavy and rapid,
 Flying in empty space,
 Seems to be a livid cloud
 Carrying lightning at its side. 
They are so close! – Let us hold closed
 This room, in which we scoff at them. 
Such noise outside! Hideous army
 Of vampires and of dragons! 
The roof-beam, pulling free,
 Bends just like a damp blade of grass,
 And the old and rusty door
 Trembles, and uproots its hinges! 
Shouts from hell! voice which screams and cries! 
The horrible swarm, pushed by the north wind,
 Doubtless, oh Heaven! crashes down on my home. 
The wall bends under the black battalion. 
The house cries out and totters, leaning,
 And one would think that, torn out of the ground,
 Just as it chases a dry leaf,
 The wind rolls it with their whirlwind! 
Prophet! if your hand saves me,
 From these impure nighttime demons,
 I will go prostrate my bald forehead
 Before your sacred censers! 
On these faithful doors, cause
 Their breath of sparks to die,
 And in vain the nail of their wings
 To scrape and wail at these black windows! 
They have passed! – Their cohort
 Takes wing, and flees, and their feet
 Cease beating on my door
 With their redoubled blows. 
The air is full of a noise of chains,
 And in the nearby forests
 Shiver all the great oaks,
 Bent under their fiery flight! 
Of their far-off wings
 The beating fades away,
 So confused in the plains,
 So weak that one believes
 That one hears the grasshopper
 Shouting in a shrill voice,
 Or hail fizzing
 On the leads of an old roof. 
Strange syllables
 Still come to us; –
 As of the Arabs
 When the horn sounds,
 A song on the strand
 Rises in snatches
 And the dreaming child
 Has golden dreams. 
The gloomy Djinns,
 Sons of demise,
 In the shadows
 Hurry their step;
 Their swarm growls:
 As does, deeply,
 Murmur a wave
 Which goes unseen. 
This vague noise
 Going to sleep,
 Is the wave
 On the shore;
 It’s the plea
 Very faint
 Of a saint
 For a dead man. 
One doubts
 The night ... 
I listen: –
 All flees,
 All passes
 The space
 Erases
 The noise.
