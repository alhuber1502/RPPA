The Grave of a Poetess

I stood beside thy lowly grave,
 Spring odours breathed around,
 And music in the river-wave
 Passed with a lulling sound. 

All happy things that love the sun
 In the bright air glanced by,
 And a glad murmur seemed to run
 Through the soft azure sky. 

Fresh leaves were on the ivy-bough
 That fringed the ruins near;
 Young voices were abroad, but thou
 Their sweetness couldst not hear. 

And mournful grew my heart for thee,
 Thou in whose woman’s mind
 The ray that brightens earth and sea,
 The light of song was shrined –

Mournful that thou wert slumbering low
 With a dread curtain drawn
 Between thee and the golden glow
 Of this world’s vernal dawn. 

Parted from all the song and bloom
 Thou wouldst have loved so well,
 To thee the sunshine round thy tomb
 Was but a broken spell. 

The bird, the insect on the wing,
 In their bright reckless play,
 Might feel the flush and life of spring,
 And thou wert past away! 

But then, even then, a nobler thought
 O’er my vain sadness came,
 The immortal spirit woke, and wrought
 Within my thrilling frame. 

Surely on lovelier things, I said,
 Thou must have looked ere now,
 Than all that round our pathway shed
 Odours and hues below. 

The shadows of the tomb are here,
 Yet beautiful is Earth! 
What seest thou then where no dim fear,
 No haunting dream hath birth? 

Here a vain love to passing flowers
 Thou gavest, but where thou art
 The sway is not with changeful hours:
 There love and death must part. 

Thou hast left sorrow in thy song,
 A voice not loud, but deep;
 The glorious bowers of Earth among,
 How often didst thou weep! 

Where couldst thou fix on mortal ground
 Thy tender thoughts and high? 
Now peace the woman’s heart hath found,
 And joy the poet’s eye.
