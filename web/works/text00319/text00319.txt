To Mary Ann Lamb, the Author’s Best Friend and Sister

If from my lips some angry accents fell,
 Peevish complaint, or harsh reproof unkind,
 ’Twas but the error of a sickly mind
 And troubled thoughts, clouding the purer well,
 And waters clear, of Reason! And for me,
 Let this my verse the poor atonement be –
 My verse, which thou to praise wert e’er inclined
 Too highly, and with a painful eye to see
 No blemish. Thou to me didst ever show
 Kindest affection, and wouldst oft-times lend
 An ear to the desponding love-sick lay,
 Weeping my sorrows with me, who repay
 But ill the mighty debt of love I owe,
 Mary, to thee, my sister, and my friend.
