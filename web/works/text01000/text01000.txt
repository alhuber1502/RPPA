Hymns to the Night

[2]

Must morning always come again? Does the power of earthly things never end? Unblessed busyness consumes the heavenly advent 'of night, Will love's secret sacrifice never burn eternally? To' light its time 'has been measured; but timeless and spaceless is the dominion of night. — Eternally endures sleep. Holy sleep! do not bring joy too rarely to those who in earths daily labor are dedicated to night. Only the fools mistake you and know of no sleep but that shadow which in the twilight of genuine night you cast over us in compassion. They do not feel you in the golden flood of the grapes, in the miraculous ^ oil of the almond tree, and the brown juice of the poppy. They do not know that it is you that hovers around the tender girl’s bosom and makes the womb heaven; do not suspect that from ancient stories you confront us, opening heaven, carrying the key to the abodes of the blessed, of infinite mysteries the silent messenger.
