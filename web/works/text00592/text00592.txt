Sonnet

The moon accompanies you while you sleep, it extends its light over your head and brow, it moves from your face to your throat and slowly bathes the hills and valleys of your breasts. I, Lesbia, who now watch from the portal of your cabin, weep and vainly beg a happy course of the refulgent moon which I must follow or love deceives me. I have to enter like the moon into your room, and, like her, onto the linen on which your face reposes and, like her, come close to your lips; like her breath your sweet breath and, like the disc of the chaste goddess, pure, tremulous, silent, I steal away.
