Elegy

Maybe I was yours before I ever saw you.
My life as it took shape to your life was betrothed;
My great confusion at your name has given warning,
Your soul was hidden there so mine would be aroused.
One day I heard your voice and found myself tongue-tied.
I listened to it awhile, and forgot to reply.
My being to yours was united in that second;
It was the first time I felt I had been addressed.

Could you guess this marvel? Well, not knowing you,
I divined in your name my lover and teacher,
And understood in the first accents of your voice
You had come to ignite my languid existence.
I grew pale at its sound, and cast down my eyes;
It took one silent glance for our souls to embrace.
Underneath that glance your name was shown to me,
And without asking I exclaimed: That is it!

Thereupon it lay hold of my astonished ear,
Made my hearing docile, bound it in fetters.
Through it I expressed emotions most tender,
And linked the name to mine to sign loveâ€™s ledger.
Everywhere I could read that bewitching name,
And shed many a tear.
Always surrounded by the most enchanting praise,
It appeared garlanded before my dazzled eyes.
I wrote it down ... but soon dared write it no more,
And my timid love changed it into a smile.
It sought me out each night, it eased my sleeping.
And every morning I listened to it still ring.
It roamed in my breathing, and, whenever I sigh,
It is that name which caresses me, and that my heart breathes in.

Darling name! charming name! oracle of my fate!
Alas! How you please me, how your charm touches me!
You are my harbinger of life, and, mingled in death,
With a last kiss you will take my parting breath.
