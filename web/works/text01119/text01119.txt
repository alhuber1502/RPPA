Address to Europe on the Death of Lord Byron

When death cuts off great destinies
A better day dawns and lights their years;
What remains to us of the great grows pure
In immortality’s sacred fire,
As if the rays of eternal life
Shone on his memory, descending here ...

With the lyre’s glories his genius was bored;
Disdaining already the impotent spell
Of the holy lute he had given to hell,
His impatient hand had seized the sword.
Two crowns there are in the world’s parade;
Adorned with the first, the second he craved;
He sought it out in the land of laurel,
And poet yielded to warrior.
He fell at the first step, first but immense.
Happy is he who falls as he begins!
Happy is he who dies and shuts his eyes
Still all dazzled by glorious dreams!
He did not see their ruin or defeat.
In their midst he gave back a soul content;
Exhaled in peace as he breathed his last,
The fire of life returned to God’s breast.
God calls your soul to the eternal hearth.
Now you know from where that flame arrives
Which, taking in your heart too strong a flight,
Devoured your body and burned your blood.

Perhaps, arrived at the age of sorrows,
An infant girl, born between two woes,
Knowing now her father, fleeing her home,
Before this broken heart his daughter will fall;
When the mute lyre and paternal sword
Receive the tears of her eternal grief,
Her sweet voice, evoking bitter memory,
Will sing the farewell song her mother heard.

Poet-conqueror, farewell for this life!
I look on your death and I envy you;
For you died when the heart, still young,
Preserves the treasure of its illusions.
As the tropical sun, to a sailor’s eyes,
Plunges all on fire into peaceful seas,
And, without paling, sinks to its new domain
As strong as it was in the noon of day.
