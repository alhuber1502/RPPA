To the Cuckoo

Oh blithe new-comer, I have heard,
 I hear, thee and rejoice –
 Oh cuckoo, shall I call thee bird,
 Or but a wandering voice? 

While I am lying on the grass
 I hear thy restless shout;
 From hill to hill it seems to pass
 About and all about. 

To me, no babbler with a tale
 Of sunshine and of showers,
 Thou tellest – cuckoo in the vale –
 Of visionary hours. 

Thrice welcome darling of the spring! 
Even yet thou art to me
 No bird, but an invisible thing,
 A voice, a mystery,

The same whom in my schoolboy days,
 I listened to – that cry
 Which made me look a thousand ways
 In bush, and tree, and sky. 

To seek thee did I often rove
 Through woods and on the green,
 And thou wert still a hope, a love –
 Still longed for, never seen. 

And I can listen to thee yet,
 Can lie upon the plain,
 And listen till I do beget
 That golden time again. 

Oh bless
                ed
               bird, the earth we pace
 Again appears to be
 An unsubstantial fairy place
 That is fit home for thee!
