Work Without Hope

All Nature seems at work – slugs leave their lair,
 The bees are stirring, birds are on the wing,
 And Winter, slumbering in the open air,
 Wears on his smiling face a dream of spring! 
And I, the while, the sole unbusy thing,
 Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing. 
Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow,
 Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow. 
Bloom, oh ye amaranths, bloom for whom ye may –
 For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away! 
With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll! 
And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul? 
Work without hope draws nectar in a sieve,
 And hope without an object cannot live.
