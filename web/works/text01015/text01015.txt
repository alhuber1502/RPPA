O Cool Wood ...

O cool wood,
Where do you whisper,
Where my love has often gone?
O echo,
Where do you listen,
You who understand my song?

O echo,
If you sang for her
Those sweet dreams turned into song —
All of them,
O bring them to her!
Her whom I have lost so soon.

In my heart,
The wood still whispers
Where my love has often gone;
But echo
Now sleeps in sorrow:
Far away my songs have flown.

In the wood
O come my darling
Where I wander all alone!
If my songs
Have now all vanished,
I’ll sing for you another one.
