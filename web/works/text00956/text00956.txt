The Last Leaf

On the branch there’s nothing left
In the bare and blighted wood
But a poor forgotten leaf,
One single leaf, and one bird.

In my soul there’s nothing left
But one love, and if I could
I would sing it. But howling wind
Would keep my song from being heard.

Winter now, my love is dead,
Leaf is fallen, bird not seen.
Little bird, come to my tomb
And sing, when trees are green!
