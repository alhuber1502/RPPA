Lord Byron’s Last Love

Byron has arrived! The brightest pupil
Of Ares and the Muses is revealed:
Hero among Hellas’ heroic sons
On freedom’s blood-fertilized field.

The hearts of all the Greeks now beat for him —
All hearts but one, though for that one he yearns;
While he brings salvation to the people
In unrelenting grief himself he burns.

“As my people do, so will I revere you!”
Mild but unmoved does the maiden speak:
“Byzantium’s crown you may covet,
Only my love you are not to seek!”

Urgently once he was summoned to her
Who is the star of his inner night;
Full of dread he followed the messenger. —
He stood before a picture of fright!

Rigid, motionless, she lay in grief,
A sword held tightly in her right hand;
The splendid figure, pale and spiritlike,
Lifts her head and brings herself to stand,

And begins: “There is something you must know.
When I was young my heart made its choice,
And to my palikar I gave his sword
Obedient to my country’s voice.

Parting, I was earnest at an earnest hour:
‘Only victory or death, we know;
Up then! and one word from faithful lips:
If you die for our people, I die for you.’

Now you see me dying for the dead one;
The sword he sent me falling you inherit;
Take this sacred gift, O poet hero! —
Worthy of me only as you bear it.”

He examines it with horror. Calmly
She speaks, “Poison!” — breathes out scarcely a breath,
And it is done; — his arms first embrace
The dream of his life at her death.

Byron’s features since that hour like his fate
Were bleak and overcast with nightlike gloom;
And soon he took the palikar’s sword
With him to the bosom of the tomb.
