My homeland

In the album of my friend João d'Aboim.

My land lacks the crystals
 From those springs of only Portugal,
 My land lacks willow groves,
 It only has waves of white sands. 

In its fields, jasmine does not bloom,
 It doesn't adorn its meadows with flowers,
 There are no roses of delicate crimson,
 Only rugged clay hills it showers. 

It lacks the sweet, melodious trill
 Of the charming, gentle nightingale,
 Instead, it has a soft, nostalgic song
 Of Benguela in its evening veil. 

Its spring lacks the brilliance
 That Europe usually infuses,
 It lacks the lascivious, ceaseless breeze,
 Only having sun rays to burn and fuse. 

It lacks fruits offered by God,
 Like the precious Portuguese land,
 It lacks rivers sung by Bards,
 Like the Mondego, in Inês 'tale grand. 

It lacks deeds of glory to the world,
 That it can proudly boast upon,
 It lacks fate, a joyful destiny,
 And if it has, who yearns for one? 

It has palm trees with shaded leaves
 Where the Soba of a wild tribe,
 In a caravan of weary folk,
 Sleeps thirstily, seeking a breeze to imbibe. 

On steep cliffs in the deserts,
 The thirsty lion nestles,
 In dens with open thorns,
 Where proudly it rests, wrestling. 

In these hills, tirelessly wanders,
 The warrior African, spear vibrating,
 The famous, African warrior,
 At his feet, a prostrate panther awaiting. 

It lacks Virgins with snowy faces
 For whom knights tilt lances in joust,
 It has maidens of very brief stature,
 Very graceful, with loyal hearts robust. 

Its love is like a silver spring,
 Where one beholds a reflection,
 Of the sweetness of a soaring dove,
 The pride resembling that of a wild beast's perfection. 

Its finery is not pretentious,
 Its heart beats with love complete,
 Its pledges are not false,
 In perjury, vengeance it'll meet. 

It knows love! — But lacks the refinement
 Of those lips where magic blossoms,
 Sadness paints upon its face,
 Its eyes gleam with a gentle brilliance. 

My land lacks the crystals
 From those springs of only Portugal,
 My land lacks willow groves,
 It only has waves of white sands. 

It lacks Poets inspired by God,
 Who extolled a Gama, a Moniz,
 Who in their deeds, adorned with laurels,
 Brought glory to the native land with ease. 

It lacks them; because fate denied it
 The divine mission of a Poet,
 Of the Poet, who sings of the homeland
 With pride, with a magical potion. 

If it were so — the African Poet —
 Would have sung from his innermost soul,
 Those who first on scorched plains,
 Achieved rightful fame amidst the heathens 'roll. 

He would have sung that son — the Soldier —
 Of Aljubarrota, the great victor,
 Who in war cries released,
 Showed only courage and valor. 

He would have sung a Count of Barcelos,
 A Fernando Lord of Bragança,
 Who from the Moors seized cities,
 Only taken with the tip of a lance. 

He would have sung in the wars of Tunis,
 Granada, Morocco, and Fez,
 Of the incessant cry of victory —
 Against a thousand — of the Portuguese share. 

He would have sung an Afonso Gutierrez,
 A Gonçalves, a Nuno Tristão
 Who first brought to the homeland
 Captives from the burning land's torrid zone. 

Among these, he would have sung too
 A Gonçalo de Cintra, who dared
 To swim in a creek and died
 Penetrating the conquered Guinea declared. 

He would have sung them! — But, my land
 Lacks Poets inspired by God;
 It's not the homeland of the divine Camões
 As poet, as brave soldier so shod. 

It's not the homeland of America's Bards
 Who in your songs, with magical harmony,
 Sitting on Tijuca's summit so grand
 Rested in such beautiful poetry. 

It lacks them; because in African land
 There's no Swan in the gentle Guanabara,
 More delicate, more beautiful, more rich
 Than the gold of my Ouangára. 

My land lacks trees
 So lush, shady, and beautiful
 As yours, in cheerful Palmela,
 All wrapped in its green tresses dutiful. 

It lacks humble waves kissing
 The orchards of those lofty hills
 That now gently moan, sigh,
 Now roar — by winds they're thrills. 

My land lacks the granite
 And the verdure of your rugged Cintra
 That from love its plaintive cries
 You sang, inspired by it thereafter. 

Nothing has my native land
 That astounds and reveals primacy,
 Nothing has it, except from the deserts
 The solitude that's so dear to a singer's plea. 

Even so rough, without artful refinements,
 Nor nature's charms and beauties,
 That bloom in a thousand fields forever,
 It's my homeland! 
My homeland for which I feel longing
 Longings so deep that they pain my breast,
 And with such vivid force as you felt,
 When on the peak of proud Tijuca
 Meditating you wrote in sad verses,
 Verses that I loved so much, and still do,
 The longings for your tender homes! 
It's my homeland, I say with fervor! 
It gave me birth, and there I first saw
 The sunlight though scorching and strong. 
My childhood days returned there
 In the time when the heart's most precious,
 In those blissful days, when only
 To the awakened world, I saw and heard
 Above my lips, kisses graze,
 Kisses of pure love, born of the soul
 Of a mother's very loving and beautiful soul! 

It was there that by sweet and holy voice
 I heard and believed in God! It's my homeland! 

And you, well-fated Poet,
 Who in the gentle Guanabara
 Have sung so many songs
 To your illustrious homeland,
 Receive this my song
 Of bitterness and sorrow,
 Without beauty, without charm. 
To my homeland so dear. 

I saw the beauties of the land
 Of your unparalleled land,
 I admired much of what it holds
 Your beautiful Portugal;
 And if I envy the loveliness
 Of your land's beauty,
 It's also very Portuguese
 My native land. 

With glory I carry in my breast
 That name once strong,
 Which I don't know what became
 Of its prophecy of fate. 
And if it still sleeps indolent,
 You sang well, in a falling voice,
 That it will rise potent
 From this lethargy of death. 

I also envy Brazil
 Shining over the waters,
 In those thousand fields,
 In those mountains beyond the sea. 
I envy the beauty
 Of those verdant meadows,
 Inspiring with sweetness
 The Poet to sing. 

Nothing has my native land
 That astounds and reveals primacy,
 Nothing has it, except from the deserts
 The solitude that's so dear to a singer's plea. 

And you, well-fated Poet,
 Who in the gentle Guanabara,
 To your homeland so dear
 Have sung so many songs
 Also receive my song
 Of bitterness and sorrow
 Without beauty, without charm,
 Devoted by my soul to you!
