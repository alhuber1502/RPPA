I Had a Dove

I had a dove, and the sweet dove died,
 And I have thought it died of grieving. 
Oh, what could it grieve for? Its feet were tied
 With a silken thread of my own hand’s weaving. 
Sweet little red feet! Why should you die –
 Why would you leave me, sweet dove, why? 
You lived alone on the forest-tree,
 Why, pretty thing, could you not live with me? 
I kissed you oft, and gave you white peas –
 Why not live sweetly, as in the green trees?
