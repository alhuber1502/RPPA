To ***

In the Alps at Splügen.

No, never, you will never let me be!
You follow me on land, across the sea,
I watch your footsteps sparkle and then fade
On frozen Alpine lakes; in the cascade
I hear your voice or else I sense you near,
And look behind with longing and with fear.

Ungrateful! In these peaks, so stern and proud,
Which from their depths rise up to pierce a cloud,
I tire of eternal ice and snow,
And pause as my own tears begin to flow;
I seek the Northern Star in misty blue
And Lithuania, your small house, and you.
Ungrateful! Perhaps now, queen of the ball,
You hold your merry, laughing guests in thrall
By telling tales of our long-past romance;
Or do you conquer new hearts as you dance?
Are you content now that you are adored
By your meek subjects, by that servile horde?
That pleasure wakes you, that you’re lulled by bliss?
Is there, then, nothing from the past you miss?
And wouldn’t you be far happier, my dear,
Sharing your outcast’s wanderings, being here?

I’d lead you by the hand amid these crests,
And with my songs I’d ease your weariness.
I’d plunge first into every stream we meet
To gather stones so that your dainty feet
Could cross the streams and never touch the foam.
I’d warm your hands with kisses; we’d call home
Some rustic shepherd’s hut along the way,
Where we’d rest from the hardships of the day.
Wrapped in my cloak beside the fireplace
You’d fall asleep and wake in my embrace.
