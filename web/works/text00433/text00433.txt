The Prophet

With soul athirst I wandered lost
 Through darkling of a desert land
 And at the place where pathways crossed
 Beheld the six-wing’d Seraph stand. 
His fingers light as sleep he turned
 To touch mine eyes and lo they burned,
 And like a startled eaglet’s eyes
 They opened wild on prophecies,
 And at his touch my mortal ears
 Filled with the sounding of the spheres:
 I fathomed shudderings of the sky
 The sweep of angel hosts on high,
 The creep of creatures in the seas,
 The seeping sap of valley trees. 
Then leaning to my lips he wrung
 Thereout my sinful earthen tongue
 And all its guile and perfidy;
 And his right hand where blood was wet
 Parted my palsied lips and set
 A Serpent’s subtle sting in me. 
He raised a blade and cleft my chest
 Reft out my quaking heart entire
 And, in my breast asunder, pressed
 A coal alight with living fire. 
I lay in desert land as dead
 Until the Voice from Heaven said:
 “Arise O Prophet! Work my will,
 Thou that hast now perceived and heard. 
On land and sea thy charge fulfill
 And burn Man’s heart with this My Word.”
