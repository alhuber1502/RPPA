Freedom

The young men are smiling,
the old ones full of joy;
my companeras, they are saying
that the people got their freedom,

and the mob is full of song,
the belltowers noise
and the balconies are bright,
squares bursting with festivities.

It’s some great news about the law
which I swear I don't understand.
It explains why we see men
celebrating so happily.

Many good things are coming
for our kingdom, say the wise.
If the men gain something from it,
I am happy for men

but for us, the females,
I neither applaud nor am saddened,
since even if the laws change,
for us there's no protection.

Freedom, what does it matter to us?
What do we gain, what will we have?
A patio to speak from
and the right to sew?

Freedom! What good does it do
if our oppressor is not
the yoke of the king
but the yoke of our sex?

Freedom! is it not a bloody insult
they offer us
to keep repeating that shout
while we’re standing in chains?

Freedom! Yes, to weep —
we’ve been weeping through time,
we wept under the despots
and under these liberals we’ll weep.

For these men, like the old ones
human and generous,
are quick to justify our pain
in any century.

The young men are boasting
the old men feel pleased;
there’s equality in the nation,
there’s freedom in the land.

But I tell you companeras
that the law belongs only to men,
that women don’t count
nor is there a Nation for our sex.

Therefore, I
don't cheer nor regret:
if they lose, God take pity,
if they win, I wish them the best.
