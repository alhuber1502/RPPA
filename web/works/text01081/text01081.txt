Loneliness

I.

Have you ever found yourself entirely alone,
Alone and without God and loveless on a heath,
The wounds dealt you by scornful misfortune bound
With proud silence, with anger and stifled grief?
Had every hope of happiness abandoned you,
As a hunter comes to a rift in the mountain
And hears the barking of his dogs die slowly away,
Or as the bird flies off to avoid the winter?
If you have been on a heath and felt so alone,
Then you know how a man can be so overcome
That he cannot help rushing to embrace a stone;
That he, whom his loneliness fills with alarms,
Leaps up in horror from the rigid boulder
And in fear to the wind outstretches his arms.

II.

The wind is alien, you cannot embrace it;
The stone is dead, and from a thing so gross and cold
There is no hope coaxing a comforting word;
Even among roses you feel forsaken,
For soon you see them, unaware of you, turn pale,
Entirely concerned with their own dying.
Go on: you are greeted everywhere by things decaying
In long dark streets where your fellow creatures dwell;
You see them look out of their huts here and there,
And then slam their windows shut before your face,
The huts collapse and you feel a shudder of fear.
Loveless and without God! The way is hard to bear,
The gusty winds in the streets are cold; and you? -
The whole worldâ€™s sadness drives you to despair.
