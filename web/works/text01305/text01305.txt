The Poet’s Dream

Sound lies in the silent lyre
Like a spark lurking in the cloud;
And I pour out in words of fire
A song not yet known to the world.

In the dark a voice for the people
Singing not because he is vain
Gathers with an unfettered soul
Immortal flowers of heaven;

Accolades will not seduce him,
Nor seeks he an early laurel. —
Honor his dream, holy dream
Of a warrior going to war.
