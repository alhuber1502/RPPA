Delphica

Do you remember, Daphne, that old romance
Under the sycamore, under white laurels,
Under the olive, myrtle, or trembling willows,
That song of love ... that again and again begins!

Do you recognize the Temple, with great colonnade,
And the bitter lemons you pressed on your teeth?
And the cave, fatal to careless visitors,
Where sleeps the vanquished dragon’s ancient seed?

They will come back, those gods you always mourn for,
As time restores the order of the ancient days;
Earth was set trembling by the breath of fate ...

But the sibyl with the Roman countenance
Lies still asleep under Constantine’s Arch:
— And nothing has disturbed the austere gate.
