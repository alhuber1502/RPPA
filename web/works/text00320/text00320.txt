Composed on a Journey Homeward, the Author Having Received Intelligence of the Birth of a Son, September 20, 1796

Oft o’er my brain does that strange fancy roll
 Which makes the present (while the flesh doth last)
 Seem a mere semblance of some unknown past,
 Mixed with such feelings as perplex the soul
 Self-questioned in her sleep. And some have said
 We lived ere yet this fleshly robe we wore. 
Oh my sweet baby! when I reach the door,
 If heavy looks should tell me thou wert dead
 (As sometimes, through excess of hope, I fear),
 I think that I should struggle to believe
 Thou wert a spirit, to this nether sphere
 Sentenced for some more venial crime to grieve –
 Didst scream, then spring to meet Heaven’s quick reprieve,
 While we wept idly o’er thy little bier!
