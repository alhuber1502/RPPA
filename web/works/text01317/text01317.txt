Three Souls

In our century of wearisome knowledge,
Of mercenary business,
Three souls were tested
By going to Earth.
And God willed to them:
“In this foreign land
Each of your fates will be different,
And each judgement too.
I give you the flame
Of divine inspiration.
The word will be your delight
And the ruler of your dreams.
I will fill each young breast
In this earthly region
With the knowledge of truth, of pure desire,
And with a bright gleam.
And if you fall into indolence
In the battle of life, —
My love is not to blame
For your false complaint.”
And upon this cherished mission
Three women’s souls
Thus left in exile
On the path of the earth.

Providence allotted one of them
To see the expanse of, a world,
Where, like a tsar, earthly enlightenment
Threw its Balthazar’s feast.
She was destined to learn high society's
Ferocious, pernicious lack of freedom,
Directed from early childhood
To lay her verses in humble tribute
At the feet of the crowd;
To carry her prayers and songs
Into the tumult of life, into crowded rooms,
To serve boredom’s cold amusement
And be the victim of mindless praise.
And she got used to and got on with
The customary, ever present banality,
Her cherished gift became a noisy rattle,
The sacred seeds fell dormant in her.
Now even in her sleep she does not remember
The good days, a previous bright thought;
And she wastes her life amidst the insane tumult of society
Completely satisfied with her fate.

God threw the other far
Into the American woods;
Led her to listen lonely
To the divine voice of the wilderness;
Led her to struggle with necessity,
To fight against fate,
To guess all herself,
To solve all on her own,
In her breast, through trial's suffering,
She kept the incense of delight burning,
Remained faithful to futile hope
And unrealizable dreams.
With this burdensome gift
She went, as God commanded,
With a fearless will, a firm step,
Until her young powers grew exhausted,
And from the heights, like an angel of truth,
Shines in the evening twilight
A star from a different hemisphere
Over the cross of her grave.

The third — thank God,
Was assigned a peaceful path,
Many divine thoughts
Were placed in her young breast.
Majestic dreams shined in her,
Innumerable songs sung,
And she was loved from the cradle.
All ecstasies, all good things
Were freely given to her,
The life of interior activity,
The life of external silence.
And in the soul, now matured,
The sad question is heard:
In her best half-century
What success did she accomplish in the world?
What was her enthusiastic power capable of?
What did the language of her soul say?
And what did her love achieve?
And what was the impulse worth?
With a past, lost in vain,
With a menacing secret ahead,
With the heart’s useless ardor,
With an idle will in the breast
With a futile and stubborn dream,
Perhaps it would have been better for her
To lose her mind in superficial life
Or to fade away into the steppe ...
