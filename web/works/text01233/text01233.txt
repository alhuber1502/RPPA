Rima I

I know a strange, gigantic hymn
in the soul’s night, that heralds the coming of day,
and these pages are part of that hymn,
a lingering cadence afloat in the shadowy air.

I wish I could write it down, and tame
man’s rebellious, imperfect tongue
into words that were laughter and sighs,
color and song, all in one.

But I struggle in vain for lack of ways
to catch it — oh, my beauty! — none comes near,
though when alone with you, I hold your hand in mine,
then might I almost sing it to your ear.
