I Have Thoughts that Are Fed by the Sun

I have thoughts that are fed by the sun:
 The things which I see
 Are welcome to me,
 Welcome every one –
 I do not wish to lie
 Dead, dead,
 Dead, without any company. 
Here alone on my bed
 With thoughts that are fed by the sun,
 And hopes that are welcome every one,
 Happy am I. 

Oh life there is about thee
 A deep delicious peace;
 I would not be without thee,
 Stay, oh stay! 
Yet be thou ever as now –
 Sweetness and breath, with the quiet of death –
 Be but thou ever as now,
 Peace, peace, peace.
