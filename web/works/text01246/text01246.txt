Song (When I was loved ...)

When I was loved — in ecstasy, in gladness,
My whole life flowed like an enchanting dream.
Cast off by you — where is the ghost of pleasure?
Ah, your love was all the happiness I knew!

When I was loved — when, inspired by you,
I sang, by praising you in song I lived.
Cast off by you — my fleeting gift has perished:
Ah, your love was all the genius that I knew!

When I was loved — charitable alms
I carried to the dwellings of the poor.
Cast off by you — my heart is cold and empty!
Ah, your love was all the charity I knew!
