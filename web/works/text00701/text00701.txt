Better a sin which purposed wrong to none...

Better a sin which purposed wrong to none
Than this still wintry coldness at the heart,
A penance might be borne for evil done
And tears of grief and love might ease the smart.
But this self-satisfied and cold respect
To virtue which must be its own reward,
Heaven keep us through this danger still alive,
Lead us not into greatness, heart-abhorred —

Oh God, who framed this stern New-England land,
Its clear cold waters, and its clear, cold soul,
Thou givest tropic climes and youthful hearts
Thou weighest spirits and dost all control —
Teach me to wait for all — to bear the fault
That most I hate because it is my own,
And if I fail through foul conceit of good,
Let me sin deep so I may cast no stone.
