[313 "I should have been too glad, I see —"]

I should have been too glad, I see —
Too lifted — for the scant degree
Of Life’s penurious Round —
My little Circuit would have shamed
This new Circumference — have blamed —
The homelier time behind.

I should have been too saved — I see —
Too rescued — Fear too dim to me
That I could spell the Prayer
I knew so perfect — yesterday —
That Scalding One — Sabachthani —
Recited fluent — here —

Earth would have been too much — I see —
And Heaven — not enough for me —
I should have had the Joy
Without the Fear — to justify —
The Palm — without the Calvary —
So Savior — Crucify —

Defeat — whets Victory — they say —
The Reefs — in old Gethsemane —
Endear the Coast — beyond!
’Tis Beggars — Banquets — can define —
’Tis Parching — vitalizes Wine —
“Faith” bleats — to understand!
