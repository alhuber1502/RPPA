[A Fantasy (extract)]

What is a poet? A bird in the shadowy wood of the world cast by God to fill his hands with harmony, but not to warble madly night and day, deafening the wood, squandering the voice given him to raise it audaciously above the bustle of the world but, with consoling faith, raising the glory of God on high. The poet was not given his sonorous voice as the enchanting tones of the siren nor like the treacherous voice of the crocodile; that of the poet, the spirit of man serene, a pilgrim through the land, a sweet and divine voice which makes him an outcast, the heavenly motherland from which he hails is always recalled and gives relief in the mortal fatigue of his journey. Alas the poet who, singing without faith, only raised a murmur like the sighing of water and the wind. Alas the poet who does not sing his faith and the glory of the nation in which he was born, vainly letting his throat grow hoarse, a butterfly and not a bee! This has been the reason which has sustained me tenaciously in this my very work and in my assiduous desire. My poetry changes with my reason and in the light of my faith I proclaim once more that I have been a butterfly this day. In the thirty years I have dwelt in this land I have been a senseless bird chirping in the forest with useless warbling and I now must use my divine inspiration which God, the sacrosanct, gives poetry, only fulfilling what is destined for my being. And here, I state my reason, when today I raise my voice, Christian and Spanish, with faith and feeling, I sing my religion, I sing my motherland.
