[“Across the plain at a gallop”]

Across the plain at a gallop
to the gates in Granada’s wall,
forty Berbers are riding
and the captain who leads them all.

The captain nears the city
he reins his snow-white mare,
and speaks these words to a woman
in his arms, and weeping there:

“Dry your tears, fair Christian,
for they wound me through and through;
a second Eden, my lady,
have I in store for you.

At my Palace in Granada
I have gardens where flowers grow,
and a golden fountain whose waters
from a hundred sources flow.

In the valley where the Genil winds,
a brooding tower is sleeping
that shall reign above a thousand others
with your beauty in its keeping.

And over all that shoreline,
what the eye beholds is mine;
neither Cordoba nor Sevilla
boast an estate so fine.

For there the haughty palm tree,
pomegranate’s crimson masses,
the leafy, verdant fig-tree
fill the vale and the mountain passes;

there the sturdy walnut rises,
prickly pear with its buds of gold,
and there the shady mulberry grows
at the foot of my stronghold.

And elm trees in my groves there
up to heaven are springing,
and under silk and silver nets
my captive birds are singing.

Lady, Sultana shall you be,
and all this to you belong,
for no woman lives in my harem,
and in my ear, no song.

Velvets shall I give to you,
and Orient perfumes dear;
from Greece shall you have veils to wear
and shawls from far Kashmir.

Plumes of white shall I give to you
to deck your brow with their show,
whiter than the foam on the shore
where eastern waters flow;

and pearls to bind your hair with,
and baths to quell the heat,
necklaces to grace your throat,
and for your lips — love's sweet!”

“What are your riches worth to me”
the Christian maid replied,
“since you’ve stolen me from my father's hall
where my friends and my ladies bide?

Restore me, restore me, Saracen,
to my sire and my native earth,
for dearer to me is my home in Leon
that all your Granada’s worth.”

In silence he stroked his beard, the Moor,
listened, and by and by,
said, as one who has pondered long
(and a tear slipped from his eye):

“If you find your castles better
than the gardens of the Moors,
and your flowers seem more beautiful
in Leon because they’re yours,

If you have bestowed your love, perhaps,
on one of your valiant men,
houri of Eden, dry your tears:
go home to your knights again.”

He gave her his mount and half his guard
and sent her on her way,
then the Moorish captain turned his back
without a word to say.
