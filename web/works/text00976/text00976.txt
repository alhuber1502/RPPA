Ganymede

In the morning gleam
How you glow around me,
O Spring, my lover!
With joy of love a thousandfold
The holy feeling
Of your endless warmth
Presses on my heart,
O Infinite Beauty!

If only I could clasp you
In these arms!

Oh, on your breast
I lie, I languish,
And your flowers, your grass,
Are pressed on my heart.
You cool the burning thirst
Of my breast,
Beloved Morning Wind!
And the nightingale calls to me
Lovingly out of the misty vale.
I come, I come!
But where? Oh, where?

Upward! The urge is upward!
The clouds float down,
The clouds bend down
To my longing love.
To me! To me!
In your lap,
Oh upward!
Embracing embraced!
Upward to your breast,
All-loving Father!
