Jehuda ben Halevy

(Fragment) [I]

I.

‘Dry with thirst, oh let my tongue cleave
 To my palate – let my right hand
 Wither off, if I forget thee
 Ever, O Jerusalem –’ 

Words and melody keep buzzing
 In my head today, unceasing,
 And I seem to make out voices
 Singing psalms, I hear men’s voices –

Sometimes, too, I catch a glimpse of
 Shadowy long beards in darkness –
 Phantom figures, which of you
 Is Jehuda ben Halevy? 

But they scurry by me quickly –
 Ghosts will shun with fear the clumsy
 Consolations of the living –
 Yet I recognized him there –

I could recognize his pallid
 Forehead, proudly worn with thinking,
 And his eyes, so gentle-stubborn –
 Pained, inquiring eyes that pierce me –

But I recognized him mostly
 By his enigmatic way of
 Smiling with those rhyming lips,
 Which are found in poets only. 

Years come round and years go fleeting. 
Since Jehuda ben Halevy
 Saw the light, the world has counted
 Seven hundred years and fifty;

It was in Castile’s Toledo
 That he came into the world,
 And the golden Tagus crooned him
 Lullabies beside the cradle. 

His strict father early nurtured
 His development and thinking,
 And his education started
 With the book of God, the Torah. 

And the youngster read this volume
 In the ancient text, whose lovely
 Picturesquely hieroglyphic
 Old Chaldean squared-off letters

Are derived out of the childhood
 Of the world, and for this reason
 Show familiar, smiling features
 To all childlike minds and spirits. 

This authentic ancient text
 Was recited by the youngster
 In the old, original singsong
 Known as Tropp down through the ages –

And with loving care he gurgled
 Those fat gutterals right gladly,
 And the quaver, the Shalsheleth,
 He trilled like feathered warbler. 

As for Onkelos’s Targum,
 Which is written in that special
 Low-Judaic idiom
 That we call the Aramaic

And which bears the same relation
 To the language of the prophets
 That the Swabian has to German –
 In this garlic-sausage Hebrew

Was the boy instructed likewise,
 And this knowledge soon provided
 Solid service to his efforts
 In the study of the Talmud. 

Yes, his father early led him
 To the pages of the Talmud,
 And thereby he laid before him
 The Halacha, that prodigious

School of fencing, where the greatest
 Of the dialectic athletes
 In the Babylonian contests
 Used to carry on their war games. 

Here the boy could master every
 Art and science of polemic;
 And his mastery was later
 Witnessed by his book Kuzari. 

But the heavens shed upon us
 Two quite different kinds of luster:
 There’s the sun’s harsh-glaring daylight
 And the milder moonlight – likewise,

Likewise, shining in the Talmud
 Is a double light, divided
 In Halacha and Haggada. 
Fencing school I called the former,

But the latter, the Haggada,
 I would rather call a garden,
 A phantasmagoric garden
 That is very like another

That once bloomed and sprouted also
 From the soil of Babylonia —
 Queen Semiramis’ great garden,
 That eighth wonder of the world. 

Queen Semiramis was brought up
 As a child by birds, and always
 Later on retained a number
 Of their birdlike traits and temper,

And so she refused to walk on
 Lowly ground like common mammals
 And insisted on the planting
 Of a garden in the air: –

Rising high on giant pillars
 Cypresses and palm trees flourished,
 Orange trees and beds of flowers,
 Marble statues, even fountains,

All secured with cunning braces
 Formed by countless hanging bridges,
 Made to look like vines and creepers,
 On which birds would swing and teeter –

Big and bright-hued birds, deep thinkers
 Much too solemn-faced to warble,
 While around them fluttered bands of
 Little finches, gaily trilling. 

All of them were blithely breathing
 Air distilled of balsam fragrance,
 Unpolluted by the reek of
 Earth’s miasma and malodors. 

The Haggada is a garden
 Of such childlike airy fancy. 
And the young Talmudic scholar –
 When his heart felt dry and dusty,

Musty from the noisy squabbling
 Over the Halacha, over
 Quarrels on the plaguy egg
 That a hen laid on a feast day,

Or about some other question
 Equally profound – the youngster
 Fled for solace of the spirit
 To the blossom-filled Haggada,

With its lovely olden fables,
 Tales of angels, myths and legends,
 Tranquil stories of the martyrs,
 Festive songs and wise old sayings,

Droll exaggerations also,
 Yet it all had faith’s old power,
 Faith’s old fire – Oh, how it sparkled,
 Bubbling with exuberance –

And the youngster’s noble spirit
 Was enraptured by the sweetness,
 Wild and wonderful adventure,
 And the strangely aching gladness,

And the fabled thrills and shivers
 Of that blissful secret world,
 Of that mighty revelation
 Which we title poesy. 

And the art of poesy –
 Gaia scienza, gracious talent
 That we call the poet’s art –
 Also worked upon his spirit. 

Thus Jehuda ben Halevy
 Grew to be not just a scholar
 But a master of poetics
 And a great and mighty poet. 

Yes, he was a mighty poet,
 Star and beacon for his age,
 Light and lamp among his people,
 And a wonderful and mighty

Pillar of poetic fire
 In the vanguard of all Israel’s
 Caravan of woe and sorrow
 In the desert waste of exile. 

Pure and truthful, without blemish,
 Was his song – his soul was also. 
On the day his Maker fashioned
 This great soul, He paused contented,

Kissed the soul whose beauty sparkled;
 And those kisses still go thrilling
 Through the poet’s every measure
 Hallowed by this grace and bounty. 

Both in poetry and life,
 It’s the gift of grace that governs –
 He who has this highest good can
 Never sin in prose or verse. 

Any poet who possesses
 This, God’s grace, we call a genius:
 Monarch in the realm of thought, he
 Is responsible to no man. 

He accounts to God, God only,
 Not the people; both in art
 And in life, the people can
 Kill us but can never judge us.
