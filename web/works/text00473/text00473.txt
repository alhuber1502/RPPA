Human Life

My poor heart frees to the wind sails of love in gulfs of tenderness and discovers in what it achieves its torment and longs for its happiness in what it does not discover. Living in this human sepulchre my content is to deceive my weariness and this atrocious cilice of my thought finds no place between genius and madness. Alas! In the contemptible life which overpowers the madman and which alarms the man of reason with horror, sweet in its name, bitter in its reality, only pain alternates with pain and, if relating it daily is tiresome, measuring it by hours is an eternity.
