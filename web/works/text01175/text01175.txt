Sonnet

Beatrix Donato was the lovely name
Which this divine bodily form possessed.
There was a faithful heart in her white breast,
A blameless spirit in her faultless frame.

Titianâ€™s son made this portrait, to confer
Immortality on the love they shared;
Then he stopped painting, for he never cared
To depict anyone after her.

Stranger, if you have ever loved at all,
Look at her; before blaming him, declare
Whether your own love is as fair.

See then what trivial things are prized on earth;
Fair as it is, this portrait is not worth
One kiss from the original.
