Venice

In Venice the red,
 Never a boat that’s sped,
 No fisher on the mere,
 No lantern near. 
Seated alone on shore,
 The Lion grand lifts o’er
 Horizon without flaw,
 His bronzed paw. 
Around him, ranged in groups,
 Great vessels and shallops,
 Like herons all adoze
 In silent rows,
 On smoking waves reclined;
 And o’er the mist entwined,
 Their standards, hovering
 In airy ring. 
The moon that groweth pale,
 Her fading brow doth veil,
 A cloud all starry lined
 Half hidd’n behind. 
The lady abbess, so,
 Of Sainte Croix folds low
 Her cape of vast contour
 Her surplice o’er. 
Palace of olden time,
 And porticoes sublime,
 And the broad stairways white
 Of ancient knight,
 And streets, and bridge of stone,
 And statues sad and lone,
 And gulf that onward glides
 In rippling tides,
 The guards in midnight hour
 With halberds on the tower,
 And arsenal turrets steep,
 Their watches keep. 
Ah, more than one sweet maid
 ‘Neath light of moon, hath stayed,
 Some boyish flow’ret dear,
 With listening ear. 
More than one hurrying lass,
 Ere leaving, at her glass
 The mask of jet doth tie,
 For the ball’s nigh. 
On couch of balmy scent,
 La Vanina, outspent,
 Still fast her lover keeps,
 And sweetly sleeps,
 And Narcissa, the bold,
 In her gondola’s hold,
 Forgets herself till day,
 Feasting away. 
And who, o’er Italy,
 Breeds not frivolity? 
Who keeps not for love’s ways
 His fairest days? 
Leave antique horologe,
 On palace of old doge,
 Of weary nights to count
 The dull amount. 
Better to count, ma belle,
 On thy lips that rebel,
 So many kisses given ... 
Or forgiven. 
Better thy charms repeat,
 Better, the tear-drops sweet,
 That love’s voluptuous sighs
 Have cost our eyes.
