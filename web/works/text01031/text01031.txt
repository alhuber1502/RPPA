Faith in Springtime

The gentle breezes are awake,
They rustle and murmur day and night,
And go to work wherever they range.
O fresh aroma, O new sound!
Now, poor heart, don’t be afraid!
Now everything’s about to change.

The world grows fairer with each day,
No one can say what may come next,
There is no end to the blossoms’ range.
They bloom in the farthest, deepest dale:
Now, poor heart, forget your pain!
Now everything’s about to change.
