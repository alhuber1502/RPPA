When Maggy Gangs Away

Oh what will a’ the lads do
 When Maggy gangs away? 
Oh what will a’ the lads do
 When Maggy gangs away? 
There’s no a heart in a’ the glen
 That disna dread the day! 
Oh what will a’ the lads do
 When Maggy gangs away? 

Young Jock has ta’en the hill for’t –
 A waefu’ wight is he –
 Poor Harry’s ta’en the bed for’t,
 An’ laid him down to dee;
 An’ Sandy’s gane unto the kirk,
 An learnin’ fast to pray! 
And, oh, what will the lads do
 When Maggy gangs away? 

The young laird o’ the Lang-Shaw
 Has drunk her health in wine;
 The priest has said (in confidence)
 The lassie was divine –
 And that is mair in maiden’s praise
 Than ony priest should say! 
But, oh, what will the lads do
 When Maggy gangs away? 

The wailing in our green glen
 That day will quaver high,
 ’Twill draw the redbreast frae the wood,
 The laverock frae the sky;
 The fairies frae their beds o’ dew
 Will rise an’ join the lay:
 An’ hey, what a day will be
 When Maggy gangs away!
