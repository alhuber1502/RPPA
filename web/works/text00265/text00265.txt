The Rovers

[Act I, scene 2]

Rogero

Whene’er with haggard eyes I view
 This dungeon that I’m rotting in
 I think of those companions true
 Who studied with me at the U
 niversity of Gottingen,
 niversity of Gottingen. 

Sweet kerchief, checked with heavenly blue,
 Which once my love sat knotting in –
 Alas, Matilda then was true! 
At least I thought so at the U
 niversity of Gottingen,
 niversity of Gottingen. 

Barbs! barbs! Alas, how swift you flew,
 Her neat post-waggon trotting in! 
Ye bore Matilda from my view –
 Forlorn I languished at the U
 niversity of Gottingen,
 niversity of Gottingen. 

This faded form! This pallid hue! 
This blood my veins is clotting in! 
My years are many – they were few
 When first I entered at the U
 niversity of Gottingen,
 niversity of Gottingen. 

There first for thee my passions grew,
 Sweet! sweet Matilda Pottingen! 
Thou wast the daughter of my Tu
 tor, Law Professor at the U
 niversity of Gottingen,
 niversity of Gottingen. 

Sun, moon, and thou, vain world, adieu! 
That Kings and Priests are plotting in –
 Here doomed to starve on water gru
 el, never shall I see the U
 niveristy of Gottingen,
 niversity of Gottingen!
