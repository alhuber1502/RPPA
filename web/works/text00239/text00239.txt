Part of an Irregular Fragment Found in a Dark Passage of the Tower

[Ll. 1-40, 129-134]

Rise, winds of night! Relentless tempests rise! 
Rush from the troubled clouds, and o’er me roll –
 In this chill pause a deeper horror lies,
 A wilder fear appals my shuddering soul! 
’Twas on this day, this hour accurst,
 That Nature, starting from repose,
 Heard the dire shrieks of murder burst –
 From infant innocence they rose,
 And shook these solemn towers! 
I shuddering pass that fatal room,
 For ages wrapped in central gloom –
 I shuddering pass that iron door
 Which Fate perchance unlocks no more:
 Death, smeared with blood, o’er the dark portal lowers. 

How fearfully my step resounds
 Along these onely bounds! 
Spare, savage blast, the taper’s quivering fires –
 Deep in these gathering shades its flame expires. 
Ye host of Heaven! the door recedes –
 It mocks my grasp – what unseen hands
 Have burst its iron bands! 
No mortal force this gate unbarred
 (Where danger lives, which terrors guard) –
 Dread powers! its screaming hinges close
 On this dread scene of impious deeds –
 My feet are fixed! Dismay has bound
 My step on this polluted ground –
 But lo! the pitying moon a line of light
 Athwart the horrid darkness dimly throws,
 And from yon grated window chases night. 

Ye visions that before me roll,
 That freeze my blood, that shake my soul! 
Are ye the phantoms of a dream? 
Pale spectres! are ye what ye seem? 
They glide more near –
 Their forms unfold! 
Fixed are their eyes, on me they bend –
 Their glaring look is cold! 
And hark! I hear
 Sounds that the throbbing pulse of life suspend:

But whence arose yon solemn call? 
Yon bloody phantom waves his hand,
 And beckons me to deeper gloom –
 Rest, troubled form, I come! 
Some unknown power my step impels
 To Horror’s secret cells.
