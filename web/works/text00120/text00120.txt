Oh Bid Me Not to Wander

Written when earnestly entreated to go the South of France for the recovery of her health.

Oh urge me not to wander,
 And quit my pleasant native shore;
 Oh let me still meander
 On those sweet banks I loved before! 
The heart when filled with sorrow
 Can find no joy in change of scene,
 Nor can that cheat, tomorrow,
 Be aught but what today has been. 

If pleasure e’er o’ertakes me,
 ’Tis when I tread the wonted round
 Where former joy awakes me,
 And strews its relics o’er the ground. 
There’s not a shrub or flower
 But tells some dear loved tale to me,
 And paints some happy hour
 Which I, alas, no more shall see.
