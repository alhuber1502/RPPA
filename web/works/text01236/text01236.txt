Rima LIII

Once more, the dark swallows will return
to hang their nests beneath your balcony,
and playing, wings tapping the panes of your door,
they’ll call out once more;

but those who used to stop mid-flight
to contemplate your grace and my delight,
the very ones who learned our names ...
they ... will not be back!

Once more, the honeysuckles will return
to climb way up your flower garden’s walls,
and, with blooms more lovely than before,
they’ll open up once more;

but those beaded with dew which I recall,
the ones whose drops we watched tremble and fall,
just like the tears of day ...
they ... will not be back!

Once more, love will return
to sing its burning words, low, in your ear,
and, out of its deep sleep, your heart
might just awake;

but mute, kneeling, absorbed,
as, at an altar, men worship the Lord,
as I loved you ... don’t be deceived:
they won’t love you like that!
