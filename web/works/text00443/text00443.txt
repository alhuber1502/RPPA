On Mankind

I

You wind, that sigh from doleful heart,
 Your fiery wings be ice. 
You flowing waters too, freeze hard,
 You tears from grieving eyes. 
Let now your sound no more be heard,
 Of virtue, crime or wit no word;
 Silent be all while Earth tells out its pain:
 All hope is vain! 

II

The tale’s well known: Humanity
 From Adam sprang full brave,
 But as he sinned posterity
 Went, like him, to the grave. 
Those that came next, now wiser, willed:
 ‘Let there be Law’ – but Law too killed. 
The virtuous fell while evil raged amain:
 All hope is vain. 

III

Then came the men of might, who trod
 The Law beneath their feet. 
Man conquered iron, turned the sod;
 Boundless was his conceit. 
And when the mighty were no more
 Man, in his anguish, turned to war. 
In misery the word shone forth again:
 All hope is vain. 

IV

Then a long age of peace ensued;
 Man mightily increased,
 Although his numbers only grew
 To spread ’fore plague a feast. 
Man looks on Heaven with longing eyes,
 For Earth his ownership denies;
 E’en for a grave too hard is its terrain:
 All hope is vain. 

V

How bountiful, how rich the Earth,
 Made richer by Man’s flair! 
Yet everywhere there still is dearth,
 Oppression everywhere. 
Must it be always thus? If no,
 Why all this time has it been so? 
Virtue and strength – can Man not these retain? 
All hope is vain. 

VI

An impious covenant has been made
 ’Twixt reason and despite! 
Men rage and folly cultivate
 To urge their armies fight. 
Beast or devil, heart or head,
 No matter which wins, men lie dead. 
Made in the form of God? Clay gone insane! 
All hope is vain! 

VII

Man pains the Earth. After the train
 Of years of peace and war
 Now too the ancient curse of Cain
 Springs on its brow once more. 
And when we think that Man will learn
 To greater crime he’ll basely turn,
 Sow Cadmus’ fateful dragon’s teeth again. 
All hope is vain! All hope is vain!
