Mary’s Ghost

’Twas in the middle of the night,
 To sleep young William tried,
 When Mary’s ghost came stealing in
 And stood at his bedside:

Oh William dear, oh William dear,
 My rest eternal ceases –
 Alas, my everlasting peace
 Is broken into pieces! 

I thought the last of all my cares
 Would end with my last minute;
 But though I went to my long home,
 I didn’t stay long in it. 

The body-snatchers they have come,
 And made a snatch at me –
 It’s very hard them kind of men
 Won’t let a body be! 

You thought that I was buried deep,
 Quite decent like and chary,
 But from her grave in Mary-bone
 They’ve come and boned your Mary! 

The arm that used to take your arm
 Is took to Doctor Vyse;
 And both my legs are gone to walk
 The hospital at Guy’s. 

I vowed that you should have my hand,
 But fate gives us denial;
 You’ll find it there at Doctor Bell’s
 In spirits and a phial. 

As for my feet, the little feet
 You used to call so pretty,
 There’s one, I know, in Bedford Row,
 The tother’s in the City. 

I can’t tell where my head is gone,
 But Doctor Carpue can;
 As for my trunk, it’s all packed up
 To go by Pickford’s van! 

I wish you’d go to Mister P. 
And save me such a ride –
 I don’t half like the outside place
 They’ve took for my inside. 

The cock it crows – I must be gone! 
My William I must part! 
But I’ll be yours in death, although
 Sir Astley has my heart. 

Don’t go to weep upon my grave,
 And think that there I be;
 They haven’t left an atom there
 Of my anatomy.
