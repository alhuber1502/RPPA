Poems on the Slave Trade

High in the air exposed the slave is hung
 To all the birds of heaven, their living food! 
He groans not, though – awakened by that fierce sun –
 New torturers live to drink their parent blood! 
He groans not, though the gorging vulture tear
 The quivering fibre! Hither gaze, oh ye
 Who tore this man from peace and liberty –
 Gaze hither, ye who weigh with scrupulous care
 The right and prudent – for beyond the grave
 There is another world! And call to mind,
 Ere your decrees proclaim to all mankind
 Murder is legalized, that there the slave
 Before the Eternal, ‘thunder-tongued shall plead
 Against the deep damnation of your deed’!
