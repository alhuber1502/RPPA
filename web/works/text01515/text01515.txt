Is it you, O God ...

Is it you, O God, whose coming begins to amaze me?
The mirror has turned to a six-tiered ground of waiting.

Every crowded speck of dust has become a whole mist of longing;  
if this world is a net, the entire desert is its prey.

The dew has polished the sheen of the flowering branch.
The nights of spring are finished, nightingale.

Don’t go unveiled into that valley of Majnoon:
every grain of sand there is an atom of desire.

Nightingale, give me a bundle of sticks for building:
I hear the thunder of the first days of our spring.
