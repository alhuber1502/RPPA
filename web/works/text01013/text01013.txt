Lore Lay

Near Bacharach am Rheine
A sorceress worked her art.
Finely made and beautiful,
She ravished many a heart

And brought many men to ruin
From the countryside around.
They never found salvation
Whom once her charms had bound.

The Bishop had her summoned
To the court of canon law
Yet could not judge her harshly
Once he such beauty saw.

Deeply touched he addressed her:
“Unhappy Lore Lay!
Who can so have seduced thee
Such evil arts to ply?”

“Lord Bishop, let me perish.
This life no more I prize
For all men meet disaster
Who gaze into my eyes!

These eyes of mine are fires,
My arm is a sorcerer’s staff.
O lay me down for burning
And break on me your staff.”

“I cannot pass a sentence
Until thou hast confessed.
Say why from thine eyes’ fire
My heart into flame has burst.

My staff I could not shatter,
Lovely Lore Lay,
Or my own heart I’d sunder —
Its life I would destroy.”

Lord Bishop, do not mock me
In this my misery,
But pray for me that our dear God
May show his clemency.

I can live no longer,
I can love no more
I beg your Grace to grant me
The death I came here for!

My sweetheart has betrayed me
And left me all alone,
He is lost to me forever
And to foreign lands has flown.

From eyes wild and tender,
From cheeks like snow and rose,
From words quiet and gentle —
From such my magic flows,

And in this spell I wither
And of anguish I could die
Of the woe within my heart
When my likeness meets my eye.

Then let my judgment find me,
Let me die as Jesus died,
For everything must vanish
when he’s not by my side.”

Three knights the Bishop ordered:
To the convent! Take her hence!
Go, Lore, to God’s caring
Commend thy disordered sense.

Thou shalt be a novice,
In black and white be clad,
And on earth prepare thee
Thy deathward path to tread.”

They set out for the cloister,
All the knight-escorts three,
Fair Lore Lay among them,
In sad captivity.

“O cavaliers, permit me
To climb that peak above.
I wish to look for one last time
On the castle I so love.

I wish to look for one last time
On the Rhine so far below.
Then to be God’s virgin
To the cloister I shall go.”

The rock tilts sharply skyward,
Steep and sheer that wall,
Yet she scaled the tower
To the highest place of all.

The three knight-escorts tethered
Their horses in a wood,
Then they too scrambled upward
To where fair Lore stood.

“Down on the Rhine,” she told them,
“A passing boat I see,
Aboard that craft, a sailor —
Could he my lover be?

My heart so wildly races,
He must be my very own!”
From the cliff she leaned over
And to the Rhine plunged down.

The knights were doomed to perish,
For they found no safe descent,
And on the cliff death claimed them
Without grave or sacrament.

Who has told this story?
A boatman on the Rhine
And still the high rock echoes
The young knights’ dying moan:

Lore Lay!
Lore Lay!
Lore Lay!
As were the three cries my own.
