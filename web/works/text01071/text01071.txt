Bertrand de Born

In every feature noble pride,
upon his brow the print of thought,
there was no heart he could not guide,
Bertrand de Bom, the troubadour.

He lured with his enchanting tones,
the lioness of Plantagenet,
the daughter also, both the sons â€”
he sang them all into his net.

How he bewitched the father, too!
In tears melted the royal scorn,
dissolved by dulcet language through
the troubadour, Bertrand de Bom.
