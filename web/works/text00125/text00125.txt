The Garden of Love

I went to the Garden of Love,
 And saw what I never had seen:
 A chapel was built in the midst
 Where I used to play on the green. 

And the gates of this chapel were shut,
 And ‘Thou shalt not’ writ over the door;
 So I turned to the Garden of Love
 That so many sweet flowers bore,

And I saw it was filled with graves,
 And tomb-stones where flowers should be,
 And priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds,
 And binding with briars my joys and desires.
