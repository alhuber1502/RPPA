Song to the Sun

I will sing unto thee,
 O thou radiant sun,
 High aloft on thy throne
 In the deep, azure night,
 With the worlds left and right
 As thy vassals. Below
 In thy glance they may glow;
 But their light thou must be. 

Behold! Nature is dead. 
Now, when ghosts walk about,
 On her form night has cast
 A black mort-cloth at last. 
Many lamps lend relief
 To the mansion of grief. 
Thou again steppest out
 When the east burneth red. 
Like a rosebud unfurled
 Now awakens the world. 
It takes life, it takes hue,
 But with joy thou look’st down
 On the glittering dew,
 And the hills’ flaming crown. 
And Life’s flowing stream,
 That was stilled in a dream,
 Now goes murmuring on
 With thine image, O sun,
 Till, more cool, thy rays fall
 On the great western hall,
 Where fulfilled is each hope
 And where virtue may rest
 When the portals shall ope
 To the realm of the blest. 

O celestial one, say
 Whence thou camest, I pray. 
Wert thou by at the time
 The Almighty sublime
 Sowed the glittering night
 With the seed of the light? 
Or perchance was thy place
 By the throne of the Lord –
 Far aloft above Space –
 Where the angels adored;
 Till no more thou wouldst brook
 The commands from on high,
 And He wrathfully took
 Thee and flung through the sky
 With supernal disdain
 Like a ball in the blue
 Which might show to full view
 That He only doth reign? 
Therefore on thou dost roll
 With so restless a will
 That no friend may console
 Thee or bid thee be still. 
And anon thou dost seek
 With a cloud to enfurl
 The hot shame of thy cheek,
 For thou ruest the day
 The Avenger did hurl
 From His presence away,
 And thou fell’st from His knees
 To the sky’s desert seas. 

Seems it long thou hast strode
 On thy journey alone? 
Dost thou tire of the road
 Thou so often hast gone? 
As in ages untold
 Thou hast come the same way,
 Have thy tresses of gold
 Never softened to gray? 
Thou’rt a warrior strong
 In the radiant strath,
 And thy bold legions throng,
 Over-arching the path. 
But the hour draws near
 When thy great yellow sphere
 With a loud noise will break,
 And Creation shall quake. 
Like a tottering wall
 Will the universe fall
 Into atoms with thee;
 And Time, that on high
 Like an eagle sped free,
 Shall fall, wounded, and die. 

Now an angel doth soar,
 Where thou swammest of yore
 Like a swan gold of hue
 On the ocean of blue;
 He looks dumbly around
 On the empty Profound,
 But he sees thee not there. 
For, thy long trial o’er,
 The Almighty thee bore
 On His arm like a child,
 And received thee to rest
 On His fatherly breast. 

Do thou roll on the way
 And be glad in the light
 Till thou reachest that day! 
We shall win through the night,
 Be it never so long,
 And in fairer blue then
 I shall hail thee again
 With a lovelier song.
