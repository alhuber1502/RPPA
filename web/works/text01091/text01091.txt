The Forsaken Girl

At dawn, when the cocks crow,
Before the stars have parted,
I must stand at the hearth,
And get the fire started.

The flame looks very fine,
The sparks leap in the air;
I just gaze at them
While sunk in despair.

And then it comes to me,
Boy so untrue,
That during the night
I dreamt of you.

Now tear after tear
Comes pouring down;
The day is now here â€”
I wish it were gone!
