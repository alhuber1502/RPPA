The Balloonist

Upon the great blue ocean
That flows around the shining stars,
I’ve travelled in a rocking boat
And met the heavenly powers.
I’ve been lost in contemplation,
Escaping from all earthly things,
And drunk the ether of eternity;
I've known the writing of the stars
And in their cycles and their rings
Seen an image of the sacred cadence
That mightily draws every sound
Into the surging force of harmony.
But alas! I am pulled down,
I view just misty shrouds.
The bounds of earth I see again,
And am driven back by clouds.
Woe! Gravity’s stern law
Reasserts its case:
No one may withdraw
From the earthbound race.
