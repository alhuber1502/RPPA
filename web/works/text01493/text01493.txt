In the Orchard

In the sunny orchard closes,
 While the warblers sing and swing,
 Care not whether blustering Autumn
   Break the promises of Spring! 
Rose and white, the apple blossom   
Hides you from the sultry sky —
 Let it flutter, blown and scatter’d. 
On the meadows by-and-by! 

Will you ask about the fruitage
   In the season of the flowers? 
Will you murmur, will you question,
 Count the run of weary hours? 
Will you let the scarecrow clapping   
Drown all happy sounds and words? 
Brothers! there is better music   
In the singing of the birds. 

From your heavy-laden garden   
Will you hunt the mellow thrush;
 He will play you for protection
 With his crown-song’s liquid rush. 
O but you will win the bargain,
 Though your fruit be spare and late,
 For remember Time is flying   
And will shut the garden gate. 

With my living, with my singing,
 I will tear the hedges down. 
Sweep the grass and heap the blossom! 
Let it shrivel, pale and brown! 
Swing the wicket! Sheep and cattle,
 Let them graze among the best! 
I broke oft the flowers; what matter   
Who may revel with the rest?
