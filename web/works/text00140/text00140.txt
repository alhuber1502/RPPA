Lines Written in Early Spring

I heard a thousand blended notes
 While in a grove I sat reclined,
 In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
 Bring sad thoughts to the mind. 

To her fair works did Nature link
 The human soul that through me ran,
 And much it grieved my heart to think
 What man has made of man. 

Through primrose-tufts, in that sweet bower,
 The periwinkle trailed its wreathes;
 And ’tis my faith that every flower
 Enjoys the air it breathes. 

The birds around me hopped and played,
 Their thoughts I cannot measure,
 But the least motion which they made,
 It seemed a thrill of pleasure. 

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
 To catch the breezy air;
 And I must think – do all I can –
 That there was pleasure there. 

If I these thoughts may not prevent,
 If such be of my creed the plan,
 Have I not reason to lament
 What man has made of man?
