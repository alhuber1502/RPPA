To a Tree on a Trellis

Poor tree! â€” bound fast on your cold wall
you stand there sad, and scarcely feel
the Zephyr that with sweet showers
lingers in the leaves of free trees
and but lightly hurries over yours.
O! Your sight touches me!
And fantasy, rich with images,
soon raises with its fleeting magic
a human figure before me,
forever removed from the free spirit
of nature, by an alien force
compelled like you into rigid forms.
