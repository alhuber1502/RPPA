On the Expected General Rising of the French Nation in 1792

Rise, mighty nation, in thy strength,
 And deal thy dreadful vengeance round –
 Let thy great spirit, roused at length,
 Strike hordes of despots to the ground! 

Devoted land, thy mangled breast
 Eager the royal vultures tear! 
By friends betrayed, by foes oppressed –
 And Virtue struggles with Despair. 

The tocsin sounds! Arise, arise! 
Stern o’er each breast let Country reign –
 Nor virgin’s plighted hand, nor sighs,
 Must now the ardent youth detain:

Nor must the hind who tills thy soil
 The ripened vintage stay to press,
 Till Rapture crown the flowing bowl,
 And Freedom boast of full success. 

Briareus-like extend thy hands,
 That every hand may crush a foe –
 In millions pour thy generous bands,
 And end a warfare by a blow! 

Then wash with sad repentant tears
 Each deed that clouds thy glory’s page,
 Each frenzied start impelled by fears,
 Each transient burst of headlong rage! 

Then fold in thy relenting arms
 Thy wretched outcasts where they roam;
 From pining want and war’s alarms,
 Oh call the child of misery home! 

Then build the tomb – oh not alone
 Of him who bled in Freedom’s cause:
 With equal eye the martyr own
 Of faith revered and ancient laws. 

Then be thy tide of glory stayed! 
Then be thy conquering banners furled! 
Obey the laws thyself hast made,
 And rise the model of the world!
