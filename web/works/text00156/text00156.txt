Away with this Pouting

Away with this pouting and sadness! 
Sweet girl, will you never give o’er? 
I love you, by Heaven, to madness –
 And what can I swear to you more? 
Believe not the old women’s fable
 That oaths are as short as a kiss,
 I’ll love you as long as I’m able,
 And swear for no longer than this. 

Then waste not the time with professions,
 For not to be blest when we can
 Is one of the darkest trangressions
 That happen ’twixt woman and man. 
Pretty moralist, why thus beginning
 My innocent warmth to reprove? 
Heaven knows that I never loved sinning,
 Except little sinnings of love! 

If swearing, however, will do it,
 Come, bring me the calendar, pray –
 I vow, by that lip, I’ll go through it,
 And not miss a saint on my way! 
The angels shall help me to wheedle,
 I’ll swear upon every one
 That e’er danced on the point of a needle,
 Or rode on a beam of the sun! 

Oh! why should Platonic control, love,
 Enchain an emotion so free? 
Your soul, though a very sweet soul, love,
 Will ne’er by sufficient for me. 
If you think by this coldness and scorning
 To seem more angelic and bright,
 Be an angel, my love, in the morning,
 But, oh, be a woman tonight!
