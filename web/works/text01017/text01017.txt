Resonance of Beethoven’s Music

1

Solitude, thou font of spirit,
Mother of all sacred wellsprings,
Magic minor of suns within us,
Rapturous, sublimely reeling,
Since I ventured to give over
To thy bliss my life of sorrow,
Since thou first didst overwhelm me
With thy wondrous waves of darkness.
Resonating to thy impulse
I have wakened into music.
All my soul’s bright starry choirs
Ring out now in godly measure.
All the suns my heart embraces,
All the planets of my pleasure,
All the comets of my torment,
Clearly sound within my breast.
In my moon of melancholy,
Every splendid sight unguessed,
I sing, and in humility
Before the treasures of my depths,
Before my life of poverty,
The mighty striving of my quest,
Eternal one, I think on thee.
All other things are vanity.

God, Thy heaven grabs me by the hair
Thine earth drags me downward into hell!
How then, God, shall I enshrine my heart
That I may guard Thy treasures? Hear my call
To Thee this night; my lamentations stream
Like fiery fountains, whose far-spreading seas
Surround and close me in on every side.
Yet even in this place I have reached ground
And grown, become an enigmatic giant.
Memnon’s image, dawn’s first rays of light
Fall on your brow and you awake
To greet the newborn day with notes conceived
By ancient night: The chosen ones are few,
Yet all who hear are summoned to aspire. —

Blessed he who, sense suspended,
Moves like a spirit on the water,
Not like a ship, flags flying
Changeable as the tide, and sails
Billowing with the wind of the day.
No; not bound by sense; God-like,
Self alone knowing, composing,
He creates the world as Himself,
And in the world man sins,
And that was not His will!
But all in the world is divided.
For no one was everything made,
Only the Lord has no lord.
Alone is He and serves not.
So too the Singer!

Nothing know I of you, O Wellington,
But the sea’s welling tones
Resound with your name so British.
Precious stone of the earth, England,
Island sea-girdled, virginal,
Ark rapt from the flood
To rest on greening hills — I love thee
Not for thy prospering commerce,
Thy distinction in many attainments.
No, for thy sake alone:
For after all, islands are holy.
Not in vain does the blue
Encircle the stars,
And gazing eyes, wondrous islands of light,
Boat not and flash not in vain.
What is embraced is made sacred,
Free state of the spirit that bears the world.
Or else who could live?

Who has pounded battle’s beat?
Who makes battle sound?
When the scythèd chariot
Rakes the blood-soaked ground,
Who in harmonies has wrought
To reconcile the wound?
Who in these late days of heat,
With such a wreath is crowned,
Who has dared that towering feat,
Art to victory bound?
Wellington, in swelling notes
Seethes and surges the fight,
Igniting like volcanoes’ glare
The holy, starry night.
From the chariot loosing a steed,
He draws you with wondrous accords
Through portals ever-reverberant.
Triumph, borne on sound!
Wellington, Victoria!
Beethoven, Gloria!
