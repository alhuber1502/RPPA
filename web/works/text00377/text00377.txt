Childe Harold's Pilgrimage

[Canto III., st. 3-6]

III.

In my youth’s summer I did sing of one,
 The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind;
 Again I seize the theme, then but begun,
 And bear it with me, as the rushing wind
 Bears the cloud onwards. In that tale I find
 The furrows of long thought, and dried-up tears
 Which, ebbing, leave a sterile track behind,
 O’er which all heavily the journeying years
 Plod the last sands of life – where not a flower appears. 

IV.

Since my young days of passion – joy, or pain –
 Perchance my heart and harp have lost a string,
 And both may jar. It may be that in vain
 I would essay as I have sung to sing;
 Yet, though a dreary strain, to this I cling. 
So that it wean me from the weary dream
 Of selfish grief or gladness – so it fling
 Forgetfulness around me – it shall seem
 To me, though to none else, a not ungrateful theme. 

V.

He who, grown aged in this world of woe,
 In deeds not years piercing the depths of life,
 So that no wonder waits him (nor below
 Can love or sorrow, fame, ambition, strife,
 Cut to his heart again with the keen knife
 Of silent, sharp endurance) – he can tell
 Why thought seeks refuge in lone caves, yet rife
 With airy images, and shapes which dwell
 Still unimpaired, though old, in the soul’s haunted cell. 

VI.

’Tis to create, and in creating live
 A being more intense, that we endow
 With form our fancy, gaining as we give
 The life we image – even as I do now! 
What am I? Nothing. But not so art thou,
 Soul of my thought, with whom I traverse earth,
 Invisible but gazing, as I glow
 Mixed with thy spirit, blended with thy birth,
 And feeling still with thee in my crushed feelings’ dearth.
