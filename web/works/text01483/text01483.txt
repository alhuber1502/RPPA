Home-Sickness

There calleth me ever a marvelous Horn,
   “Come away! Come away!” 
Is it earthly music faring astray,
 Or is it air-born? 
Oh, whether it be a spirit-wile   
Or a forest voice,
 It bidcleth mine ailing heart rejoice,
 Yet sorrow the while! 

In the greenwood glades — o’er the garlanded bowl —   
Night, Noontide, and Morn,
 The summoning call of that marvelous Horn   
Tones home to my soul! 
In vain have I sought for it east and west,
 But I' darkly feel   
That so soon as its music shall cease to peal
   I go to my rest!
