James Rigg

[Ll. 1-42]

On Tuesday morn, at half past six o’clock,
 I rose and dressed myself, and having shut
 The door o’ the bedroom still and leisurely,
 I walked down stairs. When at the outer door
 I firmly grasped the key, that ere night-fall
 Had turned the lock into its wonted niche
 Within the brazen implement, that shone
 With no unseemly splendour – mellowed light
 Elicited by touch of careful hand
 On the brown lintel – and the obedient door
 (As at a potent necromancer’s touch)
 Into the air receded suddenly,
 And gave wide prospect of the sparkling lake,
 Just then emerging from the snow-white mist
 Like angel’s veil slow-folded up to Heaven. 
And lo! a vision bright and beautiful
 Sheds a refulgent glory o’er the sand –
 The sand and glory of my avenue,
 For, standing silent by the kitchen-door
 Tinged by the morning sun, and in its own
 Brown natural hide most lovely, two long ears
 Upstretching perpendicularly, then
 With the horizon levelled – to my gaze
 Superb as horn of fabled unicorn –
 Each in its own proportions grander far
 Than the frontal glory of that wandering beast,
 Child of the desert), lo! a beauteous ass,
 With panniers hanging silent at each side,
 Silent as cage of bird whose song is mute –
 Though silent yet not empty – filled with bread,
 The staff of life, the means by which the soul
 (By fate obedient to the powers of sense)
 Renews its faded vigour, and keeps up
 A proud communion with the external heavens. 
Fastened to a ring it stood, while at its head
 A boy of six years old, an angel bright,
 Patted its neck, and to its mouth applied
 The harmless thistle that his hand had plucked
 From the wild common, melancholy crop! 

Not undelightful was that simple sight,
 For I at once did recognize that ass
 To be the property of one James Rigg.
