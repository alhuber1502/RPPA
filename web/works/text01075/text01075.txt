Childe Harold

Stout and stark, a sable bark
Sails in sorrow on the tide.
There black-suited men sit muted
As a deathwatch at his side.

Dead he’s lying, death-defying
Poet’s face now marble-white;
His blue eyes now pierce the skies,
Still upturned to heaven’s light.

Waves are flailing as if wailing
From a nixie bride’s deep sighs,
And the surges break like dirges
On the bark with mournful cries.
