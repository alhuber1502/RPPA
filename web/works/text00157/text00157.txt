A Walk by the Water

Let us walk where reeds are growing,
 By the alders in the mead;
 Where the crystal streams are flowing,
 In whose waves the fishes feed. 

There the golden carp is laving,
 With the trout, the perch, and bream;
 Mark! their flexile fins are waving,
 As they glance along the stream. 

Now they sink in deeper billows,
 Now upon the surface rise;
 Or from under roots of willows,
 Dart to catch the water-flies. 

Midst the reeds and pebbles hiding,
 See the minnow and the roach –
 Or by water-lilies gliding,
 Shun with fear our near approach. 

Do not dread us, timid fishes,
 We have neither net nor hook;
 Wanderers we, whose only wishes
 Are to read in Nature’s book.
