Cortege

A silver-vested monkey trips   
And pirouettes before the face
   Of one who twi£fs a kerchief’s lace
   Between her well-gloved finger-tips. 

A little negro, a red elf,
 Carries her drooping train, and holds
   At arm’s-length all the heavy folds,
 Watching each fold displace itself. 

The monkey never lets his eyes   
Wander from the fair woman’s breast,
 White wonder that to be possessed
   Would call a god out of the skies. 

Sometimes the little negro seems   
To lift his sumptuous burden up
   Higher than need be, in the hope   
Of seeing what all night he dreams. 

She goes by corridor and stair,
 Still to the insolent appeals   
Of her familiar animals   
Indifferent or unaware.
