Written in the Spring that Succeeded Imprisonment, May 1815

As one who after long and far-spent years
 Comes on his mistress in an hour of sleep,
 And (wondering half that he can silence keep)
 Stands smiling o’er her through a flash of tears
 To see how sweet and self-same she appears,
 Till, at his touch, with little moving creep
 Of joy, she wakes from out her calmness deep,
 And then his heart finds voice, and dances round her ears –

So I, first coming on my haunts again,
 In pause and stillness of the early prime,
 Stood thinking of the past and present time
 With earnest eyesight, scarcely crossed with pain,
 Till the fresh-moving leaves, and startling birds,
 Loosened my long-suspended breath in words!
