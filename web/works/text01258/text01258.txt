Remembrance

To countries far from here, beneath an alien heaven,
Should you desire to bear a living souvenir
Of lands that gave you birth or those whom you hold dear,
A verse, to touch the heart at times that seem God-given
And, trusty sentinel, call “Russia” to the driven,
Or should misfortune come to put you to the test
Or homesickness begin to stir and gnaw the breast,
Do not expect from me some joyous affirmation;
The muse has laid aside her songs of inspiration,
The chaplet of bright roses fallen from her brow.
In mourning garments sorrowfully shrouded,
She guards the precious urn with eyes downcast and clouded,
Condemned to be the muse of ceaseless weeping now.
When close to foreign shores the buoyant waves have brought you,
When yet the sounds of home still faintly cling and haunt you
And sadly pierce your heart and find response therein.
One thought alone fills me, one sad event within:
Remembrance of the past and keepsake for tomorrow,
My valediction take, a single word of sorrow,
For such access of grief is more than I can bear;
A faithful monument to heart-deep tears and mourning,
My weeping voice repeats to all those over there:
The brightest star we had is fallen without warning,
Is suddenly plucked down amid the tempest’s rage,
The purest of the songs of our poetic age
Is suddenly struck dumb, the lyre leaves off its story;
Our laurels in their prime, the very flush of glory,
Now fall, our vatic bays, our epoch’s sweet delight,
That with their rustling stems and sweet melodious singing
Have roused poetic boughs from slumber’s deepest night,
Sent forth the tongue of gods across the grim North winging;
Forever silent now, the poet we adore,
And we are steeped in grief, for Pushkin is no more.
