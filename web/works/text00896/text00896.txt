On the Death of My Child

[Stanza 8]

The distant clocks are striking,
The sky is deep in shade,
The lamp is burning dimly,
Your little bed is made.

The winds alone are moving;
They groan their grief around,
While we sit inside lonely
And listen for your sound.

We feel you’ll soon be knocking
Gently at the door,
As if you’d only wandered
And now come back once more.

Miserable and foolish!
For it is we who roam
Lost in fear of darkness —
You long ago came home.
