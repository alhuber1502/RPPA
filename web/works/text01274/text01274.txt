André Chénier

While all the world, struck dumb with awe,
At Byron’s urn have come to gaze,
While he from choirs of Europe’s lyres
Next to Dante hears his praise,

To me another shade calls out
Who had no songs, no tears of grief,
When from the scaffold’s pain and blood
In his grave he found relief.

He sang of love and peaceful groves.
I bring him flowers overdue.
An unknown lyre now resounds:
My song is heard by him and you.
