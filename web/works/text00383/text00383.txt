Sappho’s Song

Farewell, my lute, and would that I
 Had never waked thy burning chords! 
Poison has been upon thy sigh,
 And fever has breathed in thy words. 

Yet wherefore, wherefore should I blame
 Thy power, thy spell, my gentlest lute? 
I should have been the wretch I am
 Had every chord of thine been mute. 

It was my evil star above,
 Not my sweet lute that wrought me wrong;
 It was not song that taught me love,
 But it was love that taught me song. 

If song be past, and hope undone,
 And pulse, and head, and heart, are flame,
 It is thy work, thou faithless one –
 But no, I will not name thy name! 

Sun-god! lute, wreath are vowed to thee! 
Long be their light upon my grave,
 My glorious grave – yon deep blue sea;
 I shall sleep calm beneath its wave!
