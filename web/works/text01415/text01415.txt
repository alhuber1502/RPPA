Hymn

Bless the Magyar, Lord we pray,
 Nor in bounty fail him,
 Shield him in the bloody fray
 When his foes assail him. 
He whom ill-luck long has cursed,
 This year grant him pleasure,
 He has suffered with the worst
 Time beyond all measure. 

To Carpathian peaks you brought
 Bendeguz’s nation,
 Beautiful the land you wrought
 For their occupation. 
Wherever the Danube rolls
 Where the Tisza urges
 Heroic seed of Árpád’s soul
 Flowers along their verges. 

Ears of ripe corn wave to us
 Across Cumanian meadows,
 Tokay grapes extend to us
 Honey dripping shadows. 
Flags of ours you plant upon
 Turkey’s forts and fences,
 Matthias’s horde tramples down
 Wien’s proud defences. 

Ah, but through our crimes and faults
 Furiously driven,
 You unleashed your thunderbolts
 Hurling them from heaven,
 Arrows of the Mongol hordes
 Rained on us in battle,
 Then the Turkish overlords
 Took us for their chattel. 

Osman lips, how frequently,
 With their fearsome crowing,
 Celebrated victory
 As our blood was flowing. 
Dearest land, sons of your clay
 Turned on their own mother,
 You, their charnel house, where they
 Laid waste to each other. 

Fugitive, concealed, alone,
 Fearing sword and sentry,
 Vainly seeking for a home
 In his native country,
 Climbs the peak, flees to the vale,
 Doubt and care uphold him,
 Seas of blood lap at his heel,
 Seas of fire enfold him. 

Castle once, now heap of stones;
 Fled are all its graces,
 Death-cries, rattles, sighs and groans
 Occupy their places. 
Ah but liberty disdains
 Veins that death must vanquish,
 Red-eyed orphans in their chains
 Weeping where they languish. 

With the Magyar take your stand,
 Lord, in his vain struggles,
 Shield him with your mighty hand
 From that sea of troubles. 
He whom ill-luck long has cursed
 This year grant him pleasure,
 He has suffered with the worst
 Time beyond all measure!
