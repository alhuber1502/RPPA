The Wandering Jew

I need to rest. But no time yet. 
Propelled by conflict and regret,
 On unfirm ground I lay my tracks,
 Above my head a two-edged axe ... 
Move on! Move on! 

The road on which my feet press down
 Begins to crack, so thin it’s grown. 
The air would crush me with lead weight
 If ever I should hesitate ... 
Move on! Move on! 

The present moment scares me so. 
The future’s load will bend me low. 
On snakes I’m stepping all the way. 
I hate tomorrow and today ... 
Move on! Move on! 

I’m hungry, but it hurts to eat. 
A cool drink burns me with its heat. 
I sleep, but wake up with a start
 On dreaming knife-blades pierce my heart ... 
Move on! Move on! 

The desert throws up visions fake:
 A babbling stream, a sparkling lake,
 And golden fruit with outside fresh,
 But full of ash instead of flesh ... 
Move on! Move on! 

I’m forced to run – the other folks
 All run the other way in flocks. 
They gather like a foggy cloud. 
I know not one face in the crowd ... 
Move on! Move on! 

What is this mob that’s all around,
 Through whom on lonely path I’m bound? 
I’m like a boat by all waves tossed. 
From each change, I’m the one who’s lost ... 
Move on! Move on! 

A comet comes at intervals. 
An arrow to its target falls. 
A thrown rock won’t forever roll. 
My journey’s constant, with no goal ... 
Move on! Move on! 

Why couldn’t I just be a stream,
 To wet parched sands along my seam? 
Why not a thunderstorm, which raves,
 But soon dies out in mountain caves? 
Move on! Move on! 

How lucky are the leaves that drop:
 There’s always someplace where they stop. 
How lucky is the tumbleweed –
 It finds a ditch in which to seed ... 
Move on! Move on! 

Poor wand’ring Jew: within my breast
 Resides a heart which yearns for rest. 
Some mercy one day might be found,
 And nevermore my curse will sound:
 Move on! Move on!
