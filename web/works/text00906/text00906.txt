I’ve Loved Thee Swordy Well

I've loved thee Swordy Well and love thee still.
Long was I with thee tending sheep and cow
In boyhood ramping up each steepy hill
To play at holy poly’ down — and now
A man I trifle o’er thee, cares to kill,
Haunting thy mossy steeps to botanize
And hunt the orchis tribes where nature’s skill
Doth like my thoughts run into phantasys —
Spider and Bee all mimicking at will,
Displaying powers that fools the proudly wise,
Showing the wonders of great nature’s plan
In trifles insignificant and small, Puzzling the power of that great trifle man
Who finds no reason to be proud at all.
