My illness

In vain anxiety your friendship strives to guess the pain which torments me; in vain, my friend, my troubled voice strives to reveal the reason at your tenderness. My anxiety can be explained; the madness with which love feeds its flames, suffering most violent pain, can breathe its bitterness through the lips. Yet to speak of my profound malaise I cannot find my voice, my thoughts; I meditate and in seeking its origins I am left confused; but it is a dreadful pain, without remedy, which makes life hateful, hateful the world, it dries up the heart ... In short, it is depression!
