The Lake

In the forest, yellow lilies
 Carpet the lake-waters blue;
 Of a sudden, whitish circles
 Do unfasten a canoe. 

And I roam along the border
 And half list, half wait, most blest
 If she comes out of the rushes
 And falls gently on my breast. 

Into the canoe we’ll hurry
 Tempted by the waters’ chant,
 And I shall let slip the rudder,
 And the oar I’ll put aslant;

We shall, lit by friendly moonbeams,
 Float within the magic ring –
 May the winds through rushes rustle,
 May the rippling waters sing! 

But she will not come. O, vainly,
 All alone, I sigh and ache
 Near the host of yellow lilies,
 On the brink of the blue lake.
