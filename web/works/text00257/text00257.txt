An Island in the Moon

[Song III. Old Corruption]

When Old Corruption first begun,
 Adorned in yellow vest,
 He committed on Flesh a whoredom –
 Oh, what a wicked beast! 

From them a callow babe did spring,
 And Old Corruption smiled
 To think his race could never end,
 For now he had a child. 

He called him Surgery, and fed
 The babe with his own milk,
 For Flesh and he could ne’er agree –
 She would not let him suck. 

And this he always kept in mind,
 And formed a crooked knife,
 And ran about with bloody hands
 To seek his mother’s life;

And as he ran to seek his mother
 He met with a dead woman –
 He fell in love, and married her:
 A deed which is not common. 

She soon grew pregnant, and brought forth
 Scurvy and Spotted Fever;
 The father grinned and skipped about,
 And said, ‘I’m made for ever –

For now I have procured these imps,
 I’ll try experiments!’ 
With that he tied poor Scurvy down
 And stopped up all its vents,

And when the child began to swell
 He shouted out aloud,
 ‘I’ve found the dropsy out – and soon
 Shall do the world more good!’ 

He took up Fever by the neck,
 And cut out all its spots –
 And through the holes which he had made
 He first discovered guts!
