When the Kye Comes Hame

Come all ye jolly shepherds that whistle thro’ the glen,
 I’ll tell ye of a secret that courtiers dinna ken. 
What is the greatest bliss that the tongue of man can name? 
’Tis to woo a bonny lassie when the kye comes hame. 
When the kye comes hame, when the kye comes hame,
 ’Tween the gloaming an’ the mirk, when the kye comes hame. 

’Tis not beneath the burgonet, nor yet beneath the crown,
 ’Tis not on couch of velvet, nor yet in bed of down –
 ’Tis beneath the spreading birch, in the dell without a name,
 Wi’ a bonny, bonny lassie, when the kye comes hame,
 When the kye comes hame, when the kye comes hame,
 ’Tween the gloaming an’ the mirk, when the kye comes hame. 

There the blackbird bigs his nest for the mate he lo’es to see,
 And up upon the topmost bough, oh, a happy bird is he! 
There he pours his melting ditty, and love ’tis a’ the theme,
 And he’ll woo his bonny lassie when the kye cames hame. 
When the kye comes hame, when the kye comes hame,
 ’Tween the gloaming an’ the mirk, when the kye comes hame. 

When the bluart bears a pearl, and the daisy turns a pea,
 And the bonny lucken gowan has fouldit up his ee,
 Then the lavrock frae the blue lift drops down, and thinks nae shame
 To woo his bonnie lassie when the kye comes hame. 
When the kye comes hame, when the kye comes hame,
 ’Tween the gloaming an’ the mirk, when the kye comes hame. 

Then the eye shines sae bright, the hale soul to beguile,
 There’s love in every whisper, and joy in every smile:
 O wha wad choose a crown, wi’ its perils and its fame,
 And miss a bonny lassie when the kye comes hame? 
When the kye comes hame, when the kye comes hame,
 ’Tween the gloaming an’ the mirk, when the kye comes hame. 

See yonder pawky shepherd, that lingers on the hill,
 His ewes are in the fauld, and his lambs are lying still;
 Yet he downa gang to bed, for his heart is in a flame,
 To meet his bonny lassie when the kye comes hame. 
When the kye comes hame, when the kye comes hame,
 ’Tween the gloaming an’ the mirk, when the kye comes hame. 

Away wi’ fame and fortune, what comfort can they gie? 
And a’ the arts that prey on man’s life and liberty:
 Gie me the highest joy that the heart o’ man can frame,
 My bonny, bonny lassie, when the kye comes hame. 
When the kye comes hame, when the kye comes hame,
 ’Tween the gloaming an’ the mirk, when the kye comes hame.
