Words There are So Baffling

Words there are so baffling
 They seem bare of meaning,
 Yet cast a strange spell on
 One’s whole heart and being. 

There is in them passion,
 Love’s hot, flaming madness,
 The joy of reunion,
 Of parting the sadness. 

A word born of lightning
 Drowned by the world’s noises,
 Will never be answered
 And stays oddly voiceless. 

And yet fail it cannot
 To capture my spirit:
 At prayer or in battle,
 I know I will hear it. 

From church I will hasten,
 Afire with its promise,
 And out of the fray rush
 To answer its summons.
