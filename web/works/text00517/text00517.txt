On My Return to Zamora in 1807

Burdened with mortal melancholy, my breast filled with anguish and memories, I return again to your soft bosom, happy meadows of my homeland. How many others, alas, did my fantasy see when, distant from pain and fear, did the unhappy beauty who once loved me, fix on me her serene regard. You who, in happier times, were the witness to my happiness at the first beams of dawn, be the happy sward of my suffering; for if my blood weeps in my heart I bore hopes and love with me, disillusions and love I bear you now.
