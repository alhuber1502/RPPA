The infinite

This lonely hill was always dear to me
 And this hedge which hides
 So much of this far horizon from my view. 
But sitting and gazing, endless
 Spaces beyond, and unearthly
 Silences and deepest peace
 I imagine in my mind, and my heart
 Is close to fear. And as I hear the wind
 Rustling among these plants, I compare
 That infinite silence to this voice
 And I am reminded of the eternal,
 And the dead seasons and the present one
 Alive, the sound of it. Thus in this
 Immensity my thought is drowned:
 And sinking in this sea is dear to me.
