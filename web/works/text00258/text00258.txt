An Island in the Moon

[Song VI. Lo, the Bat]

Lo, the bat with leathern wing,
 Winking and blinking,
 Winking and blinking,
 Winking and blinking
 Like Doctor Johnson. 

[Quid]

‘Oh ho!’ said Doctor Johnson
 To Scipio Africanus,
 ‘If you don’t own me a philosopher
 I’ll kick your Roman anus!’ 

[Suction]

‘Ah ha!’ to Doctor Johnson
 Said Scipio Africanus,
 ‘Lift up my Roman petticoat,
 And kiss my Roman anus!’
