To Jane with a Guitar

Ariel to Miranda – Take
 This slave of music for the sake
 Of him who is the slave of thee,
 And teach it all the harmony
 In which thou canst, and only thou,
 Make the delighted spirit glow
 Till joy denies itself again
 And, too intense, is turned to pain –
 For by permission and command
 Of thine own Prince Ferdinand
 Poor Ariel sends this silent token
 Of more than ever can be spoken –
 Your guardian-spirit Ariel, who
 From life to life must still pursue
 Your happiness, for thus alone
 Can Ariel ever find his own. 
From Prospero’s enchanted cell,
 As the mighty verses tell,
 To the throne of Naples he
 Lit you o’er the trackless sea,
 Flitting on, your prow before,
 Like a living meteor. 
When you die, the silent Moon
 In her interlunar swoon
 Is not sadder in her cell
 Than deserted Ariel:
 When you live again on Earth,
 Like an unseen star of birth
 Ariel guides you o’er the sea
 Of life from your nativity! 
Many changes have been rung
 Since Ferdinand and you begun
 Your course of love, and Ariel still
 Has tracked your steps and served your will. 
Now, in a humbler, happier lot,
 This is all remembered not,
 And now, alas, the poor sprite is
 Imprisoned for some fault of his
 In a body like a grave –
 From you he only dares to crave
 For his service and his sorrow
 A smile today, a song tomorrow! 
The artist who this idol wrought
 To echo all harmonious thought
 Felled a tree, while on the steep
 The woods were in their winter sleep,
 Rocked in that repose divine
 On the wind-swept Apennine
 (And dreaming, some, of autumn past,
 And some of spring approaching fast,
 And some of April buds and showers,
 And some of songs in July bowers,
 And all, of love), and so this tree –
 Oh that such our death may be! –
 Died in sleep, and felt no pain,
 To live in happier form again,
 From which, beneath heaven’s fairest star,
 The artist wrought this loved guitar,
 And taught it justly to reply
 To all who question skilfully
 In language gentle as their own,
 Whispering in enamoured tone
 Sweet oracles of woods and dells
 And summer-winds in sylvan cells –
 For it had learnt all harmonies
 Of the plains and of the skies,
 Of the forests and the mountains,
 And the many-voicéd fountains:
 The clearest echoes of the hills,
 The softest notes of falling rills,
 The melodies of birds and bees,
 The murmuring of summer-seas,
 And pattering rain, and breathing dew,
 And airs of evening. 
And it knew
 That seldom-heard mysterious sound,
 Which, driven, on its diurnal round
 As it floats through boundless day,
 Our world enkindles on its way –
 All this it knows, but will not tell
 To those who cannot question well
 The spirit that inhabits it. 
It talks according to the wit
 Of its companions, and no more
 Is heard than has been felt before
 By those who tempt it to betray
 These secrets of an elder day –
 But sweetly, as it answers, will
 Flatter hands of perfect skill:
 It keeps its highest holiest tone
 For our belov
                ed
               Jane alone!
