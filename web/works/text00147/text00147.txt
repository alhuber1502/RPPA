To a Butterfly

I’ve watched you now a full half-hour
 Self-poised upon that yellow flower,
 And little butterfly indeed
 I know not if you sleep or feed. 

How motionless! Not frozen seas
 More motionless – and then,
 What joy awaits you, when the breeze
 Hath found you out among the trees
 And calls you forth again! 

This plot of orchard ground is ours
 (My trees they are, my sister’s flowers),
 Stop here whenever you are weary
 And rest as in a sanctuary. 
Come often to us – fear no wrong –
 Sit near us on the bough! 
We’ll talk of sunshine and of song,
 And summer days when we were young –
 Sweet childish days that were as long
 As twenty days are now.
