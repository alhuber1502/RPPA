The Last Man

All worldly shapes shall melt in gloom,
 The Sun himself die,
 Before this mortal shall assume
 Its Immortality! 
I saw a vision in my sleep
 That gave my spirit strength to sweep
 Adown the gulf of Time! 
I saw the last of human mould
 That shall Creations’s death behold. 
As Adam saw her prime! 
The Sun’s eye had a sickly glare,
 The Earth with age was wan,
 The skeletons of nations were
 Around that lonely man! 
Some had expired in fight – the brands
 Still rusted in their bony hands;
 In plague and famine some! 
Earth’s cities had no sound nor tread;
 And ships were drifting with the dead
 To shores where all was dumb! 

Yet, prophet-like, that lone one stood
 With dauntless words and high,
 That shook the sere leaves from the wood
 As if a storm passed by,
 Saying, ‘We are twins in death, proud Sun! 
Thy face is cold, thy race is run,
 ’Tis Mercy bids thee go;
 For thou ten thousand thousand years
 Hast seen the tide of human tears,
 That shall no longer flow. 

What though beneath thee man put forth
 His pomp, his pride, his skill,
 And arts that made fire, flood, and earth
 The vassals of his will? 
Yet mourn I not thy parted sway,
 Thou dim discrown
                ed
               king of day:
 For all those trophied arts
 And triumphs that beneath thee sprang
 Healed not a passion or a pang
 Entailed on human hearts. 

Go, let oblivion’s curtain fall
 Upon the stage of men,
 Nor with thy rising beams recall
 Life’s tragedy again. 
Its piteous pageants bring not back,
 Nor waken flesh upon the rack
 Of pain anew to writhe –
 Stretched in disease’s shapes abhorred,
 Or mown in battle by the sword
 Like grass beneath the scythe. 
Even I am weary in yon skies
 To watch thy fading fire;
 Test of all sumless agonies,
 Behold not me expire! 
My lips that speak thy dirge of death –
 Their rounded gasp and gargling breath
 To see thou shalt not boast;
 The eclipse of Nature spreads my pall –
 The majesty of Darkness shall
 Receive my parting ghost! 

This spirit shall return to Him
 That gave its heavenly spark;
 Yet think not, Sun, it shall be dim
 When thou thyself are dark! 
No! it shall live again, and shine
 In bliss unknown to beams of thine,
 By Him recalled to breath
 Who captive led captivity,
 Who robbed the grave of Victory,
 And took the sting from Death! 

Go, Sun, while Mercy holds me up
 On Nature’s awful waste
 To drink this last and bitter cup
 Of grief that man shall taste –
 Go, tell the night that hides thy face
 Thou saw’st the last of Adam’s race
 On Earth’s sepulchral clod
 The darkening universe defy
 To quench his immortality
 Or shake his trust in God!’
