Stanzas for Music

[‘There be none of Beauty’s daughters’]

There be none of Beauty’s daughters
 With a magic like to thee,
 And like music on the waters
 Is thy sweet voice to me,
 When, as if its sound were causing
 The charmed ocean’s pausing,
 The waves lie still and gleaming,
 And the lulled winds seem dreaming,

And the midnight-moon is weaving
 Her bright chain o’er the deep,
 Whose breast is gently heaving
 Like an infant’s asleep –
 So the spirit bows before thee
 To listen and adore thee,
 With a full but soft emotion
 Like the swell of summer’s ocean.
