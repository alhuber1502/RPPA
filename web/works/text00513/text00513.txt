Romance / Ballad

With eleven mortal wounds, sword shattered in pieces, horse without breath and the battle lost, stained with blood and dust on a dark and cloudy night, overwhelmed in Ontígola and my hopes dashed, almost in the arms of death, I spurred on my weary colt over rigid bodies and shattered armour. And by a hidden pathway which the heavensoffered me, between frights and distress I managed to reach Villacañas. The most comely Filena, pitying my poor condition, offered me her dwelling, her bed and consolation for my misfortunes. She examined my wounds and with delicate hands, she washed away the dust and blood which streamed from me in a black flood. My wounds healed and I gained greater ones; those of my body were cured, yet my soul brought new ones. I, unable to suffer the fire which consumed me, said to her, ‘Beautiful Filena, it is enough to cure me, enough; your eyes are more cruel than Polish lances. They wounded my body and yours burn my soul. I gained a breathing space against Mars in bloody battles and against the boy Cupid my breath now fails me. Leave off this cure, Filena, leave it, for you do me more harm, leave the cure of my body and strive to cure my soul.
