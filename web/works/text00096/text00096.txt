The Immortality Ode

I.

There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
 The earth and every common sight
 To me did seem
 Apparelled in celestial light –
 The glory and the freshness of a dream. 
It is not now as it has been of yore;
 Turn wheresoe’er I may,
 By night or day,
 The things which I have seen I now can see no more. 

II.

The rainbow comes and goes,
 And lovely is the rose;
 The moon doth with delight
 Look round her when the heavens are bare;
 Waters on a starry night
 Are beautiful and fair;
 The sunshine is a glorious birth –
 But yet I know, where’er I go,
 That there hath passed away a glory from the earth. 

III.

Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,
 And while the young lambs bound
 As to the tabor’s sound,
 To me alone there came a thought of grief. 
A timely utterance gave that thought relief,
 And I again am strong! 
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep
 (No more shall grief of mine the season wrong),
 I hear the echoes through the mountains throng;
 The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,
 And all the earth is gay;
 Land and sea
 Give themselves up to jollity,
 And with the heart of May
 Doth every beast keep holiday;
 Thou child of joy,
 Shout round me – let me hear thy shouts, thou happy shepherd-boy! 

IV.

Ye blessed creatures I have heard the call
 Ye to each other make; I see
 The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
 My heart is at your festival,
 My head hath its coronal,
 The fullness of your bliss, I feel – I feel it all! 
Oh evil day, if I were sullen
 While the Earth herself is adorning
 This sweet May-morning,
 And the children are pulling
 On every side
 In a thousand valleys far and wide
 Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,
 And the babe leaps up on his mother’s arm. 
I hear, I hear, with joy I hear! 
But there’s a tree, of many one,
 A single field which I have looked upon –
 Both of them speak of something that is gone. 
The pansy at my feet
 Doth the same tale repeat:
 Whither is fled the visionary gleam? 
Where is it gone, the glory and the dream? 

V.

Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
 The soul that rises with us, our life’s star,
 Hath had elsewhere its setting
 And cometh from afar. 
Not in entire forgetfulness,
 And not in utter nakedness,
 But trailing clouds of glory do we come
 From God who is our home. 
Heaven lies about us in our infancy –
 Shades of the prison-house begin to close
 Upon the growing boy,
 But he beholds the light and whence it flows,
 He sees it in his joy. 
The youth, who daily farther from the east
 Must travel, still is Nature’s priest
 And by the vision splendid
 Is on his way attended;
 At length the man perceives it die away
 And fade into the light of common day. 

VI.

Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own:
 Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,
 And even with something of a mother’s mind
 And no unworthy aim
 The homely nurse doth all she can
 To make her foster-child, her inmate, man,
 Forget the glories he hath known,
 And that imperial palace whence he came. 

VII.

Behold the child among his new-born blisses,
 A four years’ darling of a pigmy size –
 See where, mid work of his own hand, he lies,
 Fretted by sallies of his mother’s kisses,
 With light upon him from his father’s eyes! 
See at his feet some little plan or chart,
 Some fragment from his dream of human life
 Shaped by himself with newly-learned art
 (A wedding or a festival,
 A mourning or a funeral),
 And this hath now his heart,
 And unto this he frames his song. 
Then he will fit his tongue
 To dialogues of business, love or strife;
 But it will not be long
 Ere this be thrown aside,
 And with new joy and pride
 The little actor cons another part,
 Filling from time to time his ‘humourous stage’
 With all the persons down to palsied age
 That life brings with her in her equipage –
 As if his whole vocation
 Were endless imitation. 

VIII.

Thou whose exterior semblance doth belie
 Thy soul’s immensity,
 Thou best philosopher, who yet dost keep
 Thy heritage – thou eye among the blind
 That, deaf and silent, readst the eternal deep,
 Haunted for ever by the eternal mind;
 Mighty prophet, seer blest,
 On whom those truths do rest
 Which we are toiling all our lives to find! 
Thou over whom thy immortality
 Broods like the day, a master o’er a slave –
 A presence which is not to be put by –
 To whom the grave
 Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight
 Of day or the warm light,
 A place of thought where we in waiting lie;
 Thou little child, yet glorious in the might
 Of untamed pleasures, on thy being’s height
 Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
 The years to bring the inevitable yoke,
 Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife? 
Full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,
 And custom lie upon thee with a weight
 Heavy as frost and deep almost as life! 

IX.

Oh joy that in our embers
 Is something that doth live,
 That nature yet remembers
 What was so fugitive! 
The thought of our past years in me doth breed
 Perpetual benedictions; not indeed
 For that which is most worthy to be blest –
 Delight and liberty, the simple creed
 Of childhood, whether fluttering or at rest,
 With new-born hope for ever in his breast –
 Not for these I raise
 The song of thanks and praise,
 But for those obstinate questionings
 Of sense and outward things,
 Fallings from us, vanishings,
 Blank misgivings of a creature
 Moving about in worlds not realized,
 High instincts, before which our mortal nature
 Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised –
 But for those first affections,
 Those shadowy recollections
 Which be they what they may
 Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,
 Are yet the master-light of all our seeing;
 Uphold us, cherish us, and make
 Our noisy years seem moments in the being
 Of the eternal silence – truths that wake
 To perish never,
 Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,
 Nor man nor boy,
 Nor all that is at enmity with joy,
 Can utterly abolish or destroy! 
Hence in a season of calm weather,
 Though inland far we be,
 Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
 Which brought us hither,
 Can in a moment travel thither
 And see the children sport upon the shore,
 And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore. 

X.

Then sing ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song,
 And let the young lambs bound
 As to the tabor’s sound! 
We in thought will join your throng –
 Ye that pipe and ye that play,
 Ye that through your hearts today
 Feel the gladness of the May! 
What though the radiance which was once so bright
 Be now forever taken from my sight,
 Though nothing can bring back the hour
 Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower,
 We will grieve not, rather find
 Strength in what remains behind:
 In the primal sympathy
 Which having been must ever be,
 In the soothing thoughts that spring
 Out of human suffering,
 In the faith that looks through death,
 In years that bring the philosophic mind. 

XI.

And oh ye fountains, meadows, hills, and groves,
 Think not of any severing of our loves;
 Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might –
 I only have relinquished one delight
 To live beneath your more habitual sway! 
I love the brooks which down their channels fret,
 Even more than when I tripped lightly as they;
 The innocent brightness of a new-born day
 Is lovely yet;
 The clouds that gather round the setting sun
 Do take a sober colouring from an eye
 That hath kept watch o’er man’s mortality;
 Another race hath been, and other palms are won. 
Thanks to the human heart by which we live –
 Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears –
 To me the meanest flower that blows can give
 Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.
