Why didn’t I shrink in the blaze of that face?
I flare up, apprehending the gaze that returned that vision unblinded.

Out in the world they call me a disciple of fire  
because the words of my grief fall like a shower of sparks.

Many have fallen in love with the slim neck of the decanter;
  seeing you walk, the wave of the wine trembles with envy.

We and the poems we make get bought and sold together;
  but we knew all along for whom they were intended.

The lightning-stroke of the vision was meant for us, not for Sinai;
the wine should be poured for him who possesses the goblet.
