Hush, Hush! Tread Softly

Hush, hush! Tread softly! Hush, hush, my dear! 
All the house is asleep, but we know very well
 That the jealous, the jealous old bald-pate may hear –
 Though you’ve padded his nightcap, oh sweet Isabel! 
Though your feet are more light than a fairy’s feet,
 Who dances on bubbles where brooklets meet. 
Hush, hush! Soft tiptoe! Hush, hush, my dear! 
For less than a nothing the jealous can hear. 
No leaf doth tremble, no ripple is there
 On the river; all’s still, and the night’s sleepy eye
 Closes up and forgets all its Lethean care,
 Charmed to death by the drone of the humming mayfly –
 And the moon, whether prudish or complaisant,
 Has fled to her bower, well knowing I want
 No light in the dusk, no torch in the gloom,
 Than my Isabel’s eyes, and her lips pulped with bloom. 

Lift the latch! Ah, gently! Ah, tenderly, sweet! 
We are dead if that latchet gives one little clink –
 Well done – now those lips, and a flowery seat! 
The old man may sleep and the planets may wink,
 The shut rose shall dream of our loves, and awake
 Full-blown, and such warmth for the morning’s take;
 The stock-dove shall hatch her soft brace, and shall coo,
 While I kiss to the melody, aching all through.
