‘Another Maid There Was’

[Prelude Book VI., ll. 233 – 239; XI., ll. 215 – 222]

Another maid there was, who also breathed
 A gladness o’er that season, then to me
 By her exulting outside look of youth
 And placid under-countenance first endeared –
 That other spirit, Coleridge, who is now
 So near to us, that meek confiding heart
 So reverenced by us both. 

Methought such charm
 Of sweetness did her presence breathe around
 That all the trees, and all the silent hills,
 And everything she looked on, should have had
 An intimation how she bore herself
 Towards them and to all creatures. God delights
 In such a being, for her common thoughts
 Are piety, her life is blessedness.
