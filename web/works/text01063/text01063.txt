On wings of song ...

On wings of song, my darling,
I’ll carry you off, and we’ll go
Where the plains of the Ganges are calling,
To the sweetest place I know.

Red flowers are twining and plaiting
There in the still moonlight;
The lotus flowers are awaiting
Their sister acolyte.

The violets whisper caresses
And gaze to the stars on high;
The rose in secret confesses
Her sweet-scented tales with a sigh.

Around them, listening and blushing,
Dance gentle, subtle gazelles;
And in the distance rushing
The holy river swells.

Oh, let us lie down by it,
Where the moon on the palm tree beams;
And drink deep of love and quiet
And dream our happy dreams.
