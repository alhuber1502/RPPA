‘Pensive at Eve’ 

PENSIVE at eve, on the hard world I mused,
 And my poor heart was sad; so at the MOON
 I gazed, and sighed and sighed – for ah, how soon
 Eve saddens into night! Mine eyes perused
 With tearful vacancy the dampy grass
 That wept and glittered in the paly ray,
 And I did pause me on my lonely way
 And mused me on the wretched ones that pass
 O’er the black heath of sorrow. But alas! 
Most of myself I thought – when it befell
 That the soothe spirit of the breezy wood
 Breathed in mine ear: ‘All this is very well,
 But much of ONE thing is for NO thing good.’ 
Oh my poor heart’s INEXPLICABLE SWELL!
