Ode to Psyche

I.

Oh Goddess, hear these tuneless numbers, wrung
 By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear,
 And pardon that thy secrets should be sung
 Even into thine own soft-conchéd ear! 
Surely I dreamt to-day, or did I see
 The wing
                ed
               Psyche with awakened eyes? 
I wandered in a forest thoughtlessly,
 And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise,
 Saw two fair creatures, couch
                ed
               side by side
 In deepest grass, beneath the whispering roof
 Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran
 A brooklet, scarce espied. 

II.

Mid hushed, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed,
 Blue, silver-white, and budded Tyrian,
 They lay calm-breathing on the bedded grass. 
Their arms embracéd, and their pinions too;
 Their lips touched not, but had not bade adieu,
 As if disjoin
                ed
               by soft-handed slumber,
 And ready still past kisses to outnumber
 At tender eye-dawn of aurorean love:
 The wingéd boy I knew –
 But who wast thou, oh happy, happy dove? 
His Psyche true! 

III.

Oh latest born and loveliest vision far
 Of all Olympus’ faded hierarchy! 
Fairer than Phoebe’s sapphire-regioned star,
 Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky –
 Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,
 Nor altar heaped with flowers;
 Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan
 Upon the midnight hours –
 No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet
 From chain-swung censer teeming;
 No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat
 Of pale-mouthed prophet dreaming. 

IV.

Oh brightest, though too late for antique vows! 
Too, too late for the fond believing lyre,
 When holy were the haunted forest-boughs,
 Holy the air, the water, and the fire. 
Yet even in these days, so far retired
 From happy pieties, thy lucent fans,
 Fluttering among the faint Olympians,
 I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired. 
So let me be thy choir, and make a moan
 Upon the midnight hours –
 Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet
 From swing
                ed
               censer teeming;
 Thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat
 Of pale-mouthed prophet dreaming. 

V.

Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane
 In some untrodden region of my mind,
 Where branchéd thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain,
 Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind. 
Far, far around shall those dark-clustered trees
 Fledge the wild-ridg
                ed
               mountains steep by steep;
 And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees,
 The moss-lain dryads shall be lulled to sleep. 
And in the midst of this wide quietness
 A rosy sanctuary will I dress
 With the wreathed trellis of a working brain,
 With buds, and bells, and stars without a name –
 With all the gardener Fancy e’er could feign,
 Who, breeding flowers, will never breed the same. 
And there shall be for thee all soft delight
 That shadowy thought can win,
 A bright torch, and a casement ope at night,
 To let the warm Love in!
