Oh I Do Love Thee...

Oh I do love thee, meek SIMPLICITY! 
For of thy lays the lulling simpleness
 Goes to my heart, and soothes each small distress,
 Distress though small, yet haply great to me. 
’Tis true on Lady Fortune’s gentlest pad
 I amble on; and yet I know not why
 So sad I am! But should a friend and I
 Frown, pout, and part, then I am very sad. 
And then with sonnets and with sympathy
 My dreamy bosom’s mystic woes I pall;
 Now on my false friend plaining plaintively,
 Now raving at mankind in general;
 But whether sad or fierce, ’tis simple all,
 All very simple, meek SIMPLICITY!
