We Had a Fellow-Passenger

We had a fellow-passenger who came
 From Calais with us, gaudy in array –
 A negro woman, like a lady gay,
 Yet silent as a woman fearing blame. 
Dejected, meek – yea, pitiably tame –
 She sat, from notice turning not away,
 But on our proffered kindness still did lay
 A weight of languid speech, or at the same
 Was silent, motionless in eyes and face. 
She was a negro woman driven from France,
 Rejected like all others of that race,
 Not one of whom may now find footing there. 
This the poor outcast did to us declare,
 Nor murmured at the unfeeling ordinance.
