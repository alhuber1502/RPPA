The Crystal Cabinet

The maiden caught me in the wild
 Where I was dancing merrily;
 She put me into her cabinet
 And locked me up with a golden key. 

This cabinet is formed of gold
 And pearl and crystal shining bright,
 And within it opens into a world
 And a little lovely moony night! 

Another England there I saw,
 Another London with its Tower,
 Another Thames and other hills,
 And another pleasant Surrey bower,

Another maiden like herself,
 Translucent, lovely, shining clear,
 Threefold each in the other closed –
 Oh what a pleasant trembling fear! 

Oh what a smile, a threefold-smile,
 Filled me, that like a flame I burned! 
I bent to kiss the lovely maid,
 And found a threefold-kiss returned;

I strove to seize the inmost form
 With ardour fierce and hands of flame,
 But burst the crystal cabinet
 And like a weeping babe became! 

A weeping babe upon the wild
 And weeping woman pale reclined –
 And in the outward air again
 I filled with woes the passing wind!
