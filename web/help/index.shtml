              <p>The Networks view is an approximation of contextuality as a
              theory of space.  It facilitates the exploration of the RPPA
              knowledge base in form of a network graph and aims to
                strike a balance between the necessities
                of spatial and temporal situatedness of contextuality and the
                freedom to explore formal, semantic, poetic, as well as
              network-analytical measures in the underlying knowledge base.
               
        
      Contextuality supplements the
      temporal axis of textual reception with contextual connectivity in space.  The spatial
      dimension allows for a full appreciation of a text's complexities in a 
      space that connects all parts of a text among themselves and shows exits and
      pathways to its contexts.  Only in this space can a real
      interpretation of a text unfold:  as texts invite dialogue and
      contextualization, the interpretative space grows with it. 
      </p>

      <h3 id="networks_methodology">Methodology</h3>
      <p>Contextuality is spatially and temporally situated, meaning that each
      context carries place and moment that shape interpretation. In RPPA this
      requires:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Spatial anchoring — linking contexts to specific locations
        (birthplaces, performance sites, publication or translation events);</li>
        <li>Temporal anchoring — recording dates, periods, and historical
        horizons that affect meaning;</li> 
        <li>Integrated modelling — representing contexts as graph nodes with
        spatial and temporal attributes so analyses can traverse both
        dimensions.</li> 
      </ul>
                <p>
      Contexts themselves have a historical place and function that is linked to
      in the space of the context, thus the text enters this realm of the
      contexts' universe while at the same time the context transforms our
      understanding, reading, representation, and overal model of the text.  All
      contextuality is therfore minimally bi-directional, it facilitates a
      spatial movement between text and context, i.e. the text's place in the
      context's reach through time and space is just as important as
      the work it performs in the text. </p>
      <p>This temporal/spatial expansion historicizes a text as a ‘global text‘,
      i.e. contexts embed texts in multidimensional spaces and connect texts more
      broadly via shared contexts.
      As such, the global text evolves from the countless recontextualizations
      of the text (every reading adds a layer to this space), and hence serves
      as a representative model of the text in its 
      contextualized state, it extends and ultimately replaces the textual
      discourse with an open-ended, context-based network, or graph.
    </p>
      
<h3 id="networks_display">Graph display</h3>
              <p>The RPPA knowledge graph can be explored in any
              user-defined direction.  Nodes can be added to the network using
              either the graph search function or by expanding existing nodes by
              adding their connected (incoming and outgoing) nodes.  
              Nodes can also be dragged to change the graph
              layout, and the graph as a whole can be zoomed 
                in and out of to reposition the graph display.</p>
 
              <p>
                The nodes in the RPPA knowledge graph are coded by colour and shape to
                indicate their class (type) and ontological contexts.  Nodes
                labels comprise the class of node, followed by a brief 
                descriptive label; edge labels show the property label only. 
                An overview of a node's properties is displayed next to the
                node on hover and in the Graph information panel on the right when
                clicking on a node.

      <h3 id="networks_ontologies">Ontologies and vocabularies</h3>
      <p>Contextuality is not limited to intertextual or intermedial relations — it also
      encompasses social, material, spatial and institutional factors that shape
      how texts are produced, transmitted and read.  RPPA models these dimensions
      using a mix of established ontologies and project-specific vocabularies to
      ensure consistent contextualization and linked-data interoperability.</p> 
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core semantic standards</strong>: Dublin Core, FOAF, schema.org and SKOS for metadata and concept organisation;</li>
        <li><strong>Geographic and temporal</strong>: GeoNames, WGS84 and ISO date/time vocabularies for places and time-spans;</li>
        <li><strong>Linguistic and classification</strong>: ISO language codes and SKOS-based thesauri for language and domain classification;</li>
        <li><strong>RPPA ontologies</strong>: project-specific RDF models
        (drawing on the CIDOC-CRM, POSTDATA, and INTRO ontologies)
        describing nodes (works, expressions, agents, contexts), properties and
        contextual relations; exposed via a SPARQL endpoint for querying and
        graph export.</li> 
      </ul>

      <h4 id="networks_vocabularies">RPPA context vocabularies</h4>

      <p>To support the modelling of intertextual, intratextual, and typological
      contexts, RPPA has produced a number of SKOS vocabulaires drawing on
      established dictionaries, encyclopedias, and glossaries from among others
      literature, poetry, art, and music.

                  Below is a complete list of the vocabularies currently available
                  for classifying the contextualizations of intertextual and
                  intermedial contextuality in RPPA.    

                The task of creating and offering high-quality domain-specific
                vocabularies in support of RPPA's contextualization effort is
                ongoing.  We will be adding new vocabularies periodically,
                including but not limited to art, music, theatre, sciences,
                history, religion, philosophy, and mythology.  Please feel free to
                <a href="mailto:huber@romanticperiodpoetry.org">suggest</a>
                additional vocabularies to be included.
                Clicking on any of the terms/concepts below will show them in
                their contextualized form 
                  in the <a href="/networks/">Networks view</a>.

              <div id="networks_vocabs"><div class="spinner-border text-info" role="status" style="margin-left:10px;"><span class="sr-only">Loading...</span></div></div>
              
      <p>These vocabularies allow RPPA to support rich, multi-dimensional
      contextualizations, enable graph-based discovery, and facilitate reuse
      across digital humanities tools. </p>

    <h3 id="networks_scholarship">Open Scholarship</h3>
    <p>Thanks to the nature of Romanticism as a global phenomenon, reading
      global Romanticism will more often than not be reading in translation (i.e.
      distantly).  Additionally, ‘global texts‘ are 'open texts', they invite
      readers to participate in their creation.  Finally, a database of
      contextuality like RPPA's constitutes a corpus of a higher order
      (a network) that is in itself a valuable object of study beyond the concrete 
      work contexts perform in the texts.  Taken together, it is only through
    collaboration and participation that all of these challenges can be addressed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>subject and domain expertise of poetic traditions within and across national
        literatures;</li>
      <li>comparatist approaches to look beyond the artistic
          aspects to the expression of broader literary and cultural trends,
          mapping it onto the evolution of forms, genres, and ideas/motifs;</li>
      <li>computational approaches from ontological modelling to
          network analysis and mapping approaches.</li>
    </ul>  


              <h2 id="maps">Maps</h2>
              <p>The historical map used in the visualization is John Arrowsmith's <em><a

                (London: J. Arrowsmith, 1844). While the original map centres on the
                Pacific region, it is Western/Northern-centric in other ways, not least with regard
                to its place of manufacture and its Mercartor projection. For geo-referencing
                purposes the map has been aligned with the Web Mercator
                projection, the de facto standard for maps on the web.

              <p>
                Primarily conceived as a visual access point at the moment, our aim is to use
                maps and mapping as an analytical tool that facilitates multi-perspectival
                approaches, mitigates ambiguity and uncertainty, helps to consider and appreciate
                the evolution of national literatures and literary spaces alongside the
                world literary space portrayed on the world canvas, and benefits from the
                participatory nature of RPPA to arrive at more useful representations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over time, as the networks of contextuality on the world canvas become more
                apparent, we envision the emergence of dynamic maps at a higher
                levels of detail. We expect these to reveal more contexts and the inner-
                as well as extra-literary structures that underpin and facilitate the construction
                of global texts and will allow for a more detailed representation and analysis
                of their components and evolution.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we map out, literally and figuratively spoken, the poetry of the
                global Romantic period, we address not only its temporal challenges,
                but also embrace the geographic, linguistic, and
                cultural diversity of the various stages of a global artistic phenomenon.
                We hope that by virtue of the project's historical focus on the Romantic
                period, its comparative focus on contextuality and the building of global
                texts, and its collaborative and participatory nature, the map can be
                useful as an emerging historical canvas for the
                poetry of the global Romantic period.

                used in the map navigation correspond to present-day denominations and
                historical reality. We <em>apologize</em> for the resulting distortion
                and historical inaccuracy, and hope to improve this over time with the
                help of projects like
                <a href="https://openhistoricalmap.org/" class="external" target="_blank">OpenHistoricalMap</a> as they
                evolve and mature.

                RPPA participates in the <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/Main_Page"
                class="external" target="_blank">Semantic Web</a>
                of literatures and 
                literary studies and contributes to the wider knowledge 
                base on the global Romantic period.  Its use of computational
                methods as well as peer contributions to contextualize large
                multi-lingual corpora with regard to both form and content aims
                at arriving at a global network of contexts.  This
                network facilitates model-building that can lead to insights
                about the historical and geographic dynamics of the network,
                resulting in a knowledge base of the period that can be
                re-used, queried and combined with related digital scholarship,
                and that facilitates further enquiry. To this end, RPPA provides
                access to its knowledge base via a public SPARQL endpoint, which
               powers the <a href="/query/gui/">RPPA Query Service</a>.

                    <li><em>SPARQL:</em><br> 
              The RPPA knowledge base is hosted on the <a
              href="https://www.prisms.digital" target="_blank" class="external">PRISMS</a> OpenScholarship
              platform and is accessible via a dedicated RPPA SPARQL endpoint
              &lt;https://data.prisms.digital/query/rppa/sparql&gt;.  The
              endpoint is a
                    deployment of <a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/" class="external" target="_blank">Apache Jena Fuseki</a>, which supports the
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/" class="external" target="_blank">SPARQL 1.1 Query Language</a> and
                    content negotiation for the following content types with SELECT
                    queries: <code>text/csv, text/plain, application/sparql-results+json,</code> and 
                    <code>application/sparql-results+xml</code> (URL parameter 
                    <code>?format=csv|text|json|xml</code>).
                    The RPPA SPARQL endpoint currently employs the <a
                    href="https://github.com/wikimedia/wikidata-query-gui"

                   GUI</a>,
                    but you should be able to use any SPARQL GUI, e.g. <a href="https://yasgui.triply.cc/" class="external" target="_blank">Yasgui</a>, with the above endpoint URI.
