                for short, is a new open access digital platform of
                global Romantic-period poetry.
                Global here in the sense of Felicity Nussbaum's definition of the
                "Global 18th century", namely as a spatially and conceptually
                expanded paradigm in which dialogue and exchange rather than
                influence and reception are the dominant categories.<sup>2</sup>
                RPPA comprises a <em>full-text poetry database</em> and
                an <em>open scholarship</em> platform. It embraces both
                traditional modes of scholarly research and output, such as the
                creation of scholarly editions, and digital modes of research
                and publication, such as computationally-augmented analysis,
                visualizations, network analysis, knowledge modelling, and more.
              </p>
              <h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
              <p>Comparative in nature, RPPA conceptualizes Romanticism as
                a global, deeply interconnected phenomenon.
                It embraces a <em>Romantic Weltliteratur</em> by
                bringing well- and lesser-known poets, their poems and
                contexts from all parts of the world into conversation,
                and thus encourages the telling of bigger stories.
                This “zooming out” not only brings texts, authors,
                languages, and cultures into conversation, but also
                highlights the (frequently non-linear) modes of transmission,
                circulation, and reception of
                literature (understood here in global terms as the
                expressions of a culture in a variety of forms).
                These matters will be considered alongside the
                conversations the texts enter into with each other,
                directly, or much more frequently, indirectly.
              </p>
              <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
              <p>
                RPPA participates in movements that aim to address
                issues of scale in academic Romanticism by expanding the
                Romantic literary canon. Unrestrained by the
                limitations of traditional print publications, RPPA
                comprises various literary and non-literary genres of
                Romanticism from all nations throughout the long
                <em>Romantic century</em>.<sup>3</sup> As a
                networked effort, RPPA links the literary practices,
                interrelations, and contexts of Romantic-period poetry.
                It connects these nodes reflexively as well as to
                various internal and external contexts.
              </p>
              <p>Despite every effort to include the most relevant figures of the
                Romantic period, a disclaimer needs to be issued regarding the
                inclusion or omission of poets. While "Romantic" itself is a notoriously
                "elastic" label (Michael Ferber's term) that includes "pre"-, "early"-,
                "proto"-, "high"-, "late"-, and "post"-Romantic incarnations, the
                scholarship that underlies much of the selection process is largely
                Western/Northern-centric and may have been superseeded within national
                contexts. In such cases, the
                <a href="mailto:huber@romanticperiodpoetry.org">editor</a>
                would be grateful for any corrections and suggestions for additions and
                improvements.
              </p>
              <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>RPPA will assemble an extensive and open-ended archive of
                  TEI/XML-encoded full-text poems (both original and in
                  translation) and their contexts;
                <li>RPPA is transdisciplinary and intermedial, transcending
                  literature, and embracing wider cultural production;
                <li>RPPA considers Romanticism in global, transnational
                  contexts and foregrounds its multi-lingualism and -culturalism;
                <li>RPPA adopts a positive conceptualization of translation as
                  the “closest” form of reading, one that many Romantics
                  considered a vital part of their literary labours;
                <li>RPPA facilitates and supports comparison as a method by
                  providing tools that situate Romantic-period poetry in its
                  international and interdisciplinary contexts;
                <li>RPPA fosters collaboration and participation to
                  turn obstacles to the study of global Romantic-period
                  poetry (such as “distant” reading and, unavoidably, limited
                  contextual knowledge) into opportunities for learning;
                <li>RPPA encourages new research into global Romantic-period
                  poetry and showcases ways to integrate RPPA into the
                  curriculum;
                <li>RPPA incorporates digital humanities approaches as a
                  form of comparative literary study.
              </ul>
              <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
              <p>RPPA employs digital methods from the multilingual Digital
                Humanities and the Semantic Web.
              <h3 id="multilingual_dh">Multilingual DH</h2>
                <p>A combination of ML/AI- and
                  NLP-approaches is our starting point for the detection of formal
                  poetic features and points of contact more generally (shared poetic
                  genres and devices, semantic features such as motifs, themes,
                  plots, topics, characters, and types of intertextuality) within and
                  across literatures. Designed as a collaborative and open-ended
                  effort from the
                  start, it is however through inviting input from and
                  seeking collaboration with domain experts from various traditions,
                  and by encouraging participation from the wider scholarly community
                  that RPPA hopes to address some of the main challenges of "distant
                  reading".

                <h3 id="semantic_web">Semantic Web</h3>
                <p> RPPA is built on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/" target="_blank"
                    class="external">Semantic Web</a>, it embraces formal ontological
                  modelling (RDF) and Linked Open Data (LOD)
                  standards and methodologies. RPPA is powered by an ontologically
                  underpinned, ever-expanding knowledge base, hosted on the <a href="https://www.prisms.digital/"
                    class="external" target="_blank">PRISMS</a> Open Scholarship platform, drawing on a number
                  of domain-specific ontologies (<a target="_blank" class="external"

                  which comprise an integrated framework.
                  This shared framework
                  provides a unified mechanism for the cross-linguistic representation
                  of the poems while maintaining the ability to describe them
                  adequately within their historical, cultural and poetic traditions. It also
                  facilitates the semantic modelling of contextuality/intertextuality on a granular level.

                <p>RPPA is an independently-funded research project. It was in
                  <span style="font-variant:small-caps">public alpha</span>
                  development from late 2020-2025. It is currently in <span style="font-variant:small-caps">open beta</span>,
                  i.e. ready
                  for use as feedback is gathered to improve functionality and usability.
                  As with other projects conceived
                  as long-term <em>archival</em> endeavours, all research outputs of
                  the project will be preserved and made accessible indefinitely.
                  RPPA is designed to be a networked effort: expressions of interest
                  to connect with and participate in the project are welcome at any
                  time.
                  Regular updates about new resources or functionality will be posted on our social media

                <h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>
                <p>
                  The expected outcome of this project is a fuller
                  understanding, appreciation, and engagement with the
                  poetry of the global Romantic period. As a project, RPPA
                  prioritizes the idea of “wholeness” of an archival
                  approach over analytical accounts of established
                  narratives. Wholeness not in the sense of <em>one</em>
                  grand or better narrative or history, but rather in
                  acknowledging, collecting, and aggregating <em>many</em> individual
                  stories in one bigger space. A space for the exploration
                  of new contexts and the construction of new global texts<sup>4</sup>
                  that cast a fresh light on the seemingly familiar. This project
                  provides that space.</p>
