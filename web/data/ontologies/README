This folder contains all the ontologies used.

It looks like all compatible models in CIDOC-CRM are subclassed, so there will only be a single root,
CRM Entity.  Should I also be offering the compatible models as stand-alone ontologies?

I am using the latest stable versions of all ontologies as of end of 2024.
