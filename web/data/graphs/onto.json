The recording of the donor or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E10 Transfer of Custody there is either no donor or no recipient. \nDepending on the circumstances, it may describe: \n1. the beginning of custody (there is no previous custodian)\n2. the end of custody (there is no subsequent custodian)\n3. the transfer of custody (transfer from one custodian to the next)\n4. the receipt of custody from an unknown source (the previous custodian is unknown)\n5. the declared loss of an object (the current or subsequent custodian is unknown)\nIn the event that only a single kind of transfer of custody occurs, either the legal responsibility for the custody or the actual physical possession of the object but not both, this difference should be expressed using the property \nP2 has type (is type of).\nThe sense of physical possession requires that the object of custody be in the hands of the keeper at least with a part representative for the whole. The way, in which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept instance of E18 Physical Thing.\nThe interpretation of the museum notion of \"accession\" differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these. \nTheft is a specific case of illegal transfer of custody.\n\nExamples:\n- the delivery of the paintings by Secure Deliveries Inc. to the National Gallery\n- the return of Picasso’s “Guernica” to Madrid’s Prado in 1981 (Chipp, 1988)\n- the transfer of custody of the work described as “Von der Velden ein Ufer an der See” from Johann Matthäus von Merian to the Auction House Heldevier (Jacob) for the purpose of sale, ca. 1716\n- the transfer of custody of the painting ‘Mrs. Fitzherbert’ to the art dealer Knoedler from Parke-Bernet Galleries (New York, NY, USA) ca.

It also includes the conservation treatment of an object.\nSince the distinction between modification and production is not always clear, modification is regarded as the more generally applicable concept. This implies that some items may be consumed or destroyed in an instance of E11 Modification, and that others may be produced as a result of it. An event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities.\nAn activity undertaken on an object which was designed to alter it, but which, in fact, it did not in any seemingly significant way (such as the application of a solvent during conservation which failed to dissolve any part of the object), is still considered as an instance of E11 Modification. Typically, any such activity will leave at least forensic traces of evidence on the object.\nIf the instance of E29 Design or Procedure utilized for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using property P68 foresees use of (use foreseen by): E57 Material of E29 Design or Procedure, rather than via P126 employed (was employed in): E57 Material.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain (E12) (Gregor, 1971)\n- the impregnation of the Vasa warship in Stockholm for preservation after 1956 (Håfors, 2010)\n- the transformation of the Enola Gay into a museum exhibit by the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC between 1993 and 1995 (E12, E81) (Yakel, 2000)\n- the last renewal of the gold coating of the Toshogu shrine in Nikko, Japan (Cali and Dougil, 2012)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E11(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n","label":"E11 Modification","subclass":["crm:E12_Production","crm:E79_Part_Addition","crm:E80_Part_Removal","crmdig:D7_Digital_Machine_Event"],"superclass":["crm:E7_Activity"],"type":"class"},"crm:E12_Production":{"about":"http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E12_Production","comment":"Scope note:\nThis class comprises activities that are designed to, and succeed in, creating one or more new items. \nIt specializes the notion of modification into production. The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered “new” if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one. \nThis entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event. \nAn event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain (Gregor, 1971)\n- the first casting of the Little Mermaid from the harbour of Copenhagen (Dewey, 2003)\n- Rembrandt’s creating of the seventh state of his etching “Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove”, 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12, E65, E81) (Hind, 1923)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E12(x) ⇒ E11(x)\n- E12(x) ⇒ E63(x)\n","label":"E12 Production","subclass":["lrmoo:F28_Expression_Creation","lrmoo:F30_Manifestation_Creation","lrmoo:F32_Item_Production_Event","lrmoo:F33_Reproduction_Event"],"superclass":["crm:E11_Modification","crm:E63_Beginning_of_Existence"],"type":"class"},"crm:E13_Attribute_Assignment":{"about":"http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E13_Attribute_Assignment","comment":"Scope note:\nThis class comprises the actions of making assertions about one property of an object or any single relation between two items or concepts. The type of the property asserted to hold between two items or concepts can be described by the property P177 assigned property of type (is type of property assigned): E55 Type. \nFor example, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain scientific/scholarly procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on whether this information should be accessible by structured queries.\nThis class allows for the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. Note that all instances of properties described in a knowledge base are the opinion of someone. Per default, they are the opinion of the team maintaining the knowledge base. This fact must not individually be registered for all instances of properties provided by the maintaining team, because it would result in an endless recursion of whose opinion was the description of an opinion. Therefore, the use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment marks the fact that the maintaining team is in general neutral to the validity of the respective assertion, but registers someone else’s opinion and how it came about.\nAll properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly relating the respective pair of items or concepts. Multiple use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment may possibly lead to a collection of contradictory values.\n\nExamples:\n- the examination of MS Sinai Greek 418 by Nicholas Pickwoad in November 2003 (Honey & Pickwoad, 2010)\n- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr’s silver cup in February 1997 (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E13(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n","label":"E13 Attribute Assignment","subclass":["crm:E14_Condition_Assessment","crm:E15_Identifier_Assignment","crm:E16_Measurement","crm:E17_Type_Assignment"],"superclass":["crm:E7_Activity"],"type":"class"},"crm:E14_Condition_Assessment":{"about":"http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E14_Condition_Assessment","comment":"Scope note:\nThis class describes the act of assessing the state of preservation of an object during a particular period. \nThe condition assessment may be carried out by inspection, measurement, or through historical research.

An instance of E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.\nExamples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when, and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.\nThe fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as “preferred identifier assignment”, to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment through the P2 has type (is type of) property.\n\nExamples:\n- replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17(th) century lamentation cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens\n- assigning the author and uniform title heading “Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832.

The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Methods and devices employed should be associated with instances of E16 Measurement by properties such as P33 used specific technique: E29 Design or Procedure, P125 used object of type: E55 Type, P16 used specific object (was used for): E70 Thing, whereas basic techniques such as \"carbon-14 dating\" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of): E55 Type. Details of methods and devices reused or reusable in other instances of E16 Measurement should be documented for these entities rather than the measurements themselves, whereas details of particular execution may be documented by free text or by instantiating adequate sub-activities, if the detail may be of interest for an overarching query.\nRegardless whether a measurement is made by an instrument or by human senses, it represents the initial transition from physical reality to information without any other documented information object in between within the reasoning chain that would represent the result of the interaction of the observer or device with reality. Therefore, determining properties of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is regarded as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment, which may be inferred from observing and measuring representative carriers. In the case that the carrier can be named, the property P16 used specific object (was used for) should be used to indicate the instance(s) of E18 Physical Thing that was used as the empirical basis for the attribute assignment. For instance, inferring properties of depicted items using image material, such as satellite images, is not regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement, but as a subsequent instance of E13 Attribute Assignment. Rather, only the production of the images, understood as arrays of radiation intensities, is regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement. The same reasoning holds for other sensor data.\n\nExamples:\n- measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (fictitious)\n- the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 [The carbon 14 dating of an approximately 400.000 year old complete Old Palaeolithic wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany, in 1995.] (Kouwenhoven, 1997)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E16(x) ⇒ E13(x)\n","label":"E16 Measurement","subclass":["crmdig:D11_Digital_Measurement_Event"],"superclass":["crm:E13_Attribute_Assignment"],"type":"class"},"crm:E17_Type_Assignment":{"about":"http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E17_Type_Assignment","comment":"Scope note:\nThis class comprises the actions of classifying items of whatever kind.

This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore, E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e. an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e. an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\nE4 Period is a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance, it is possible to discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomenon while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\nTypical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\nA geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice. The spatiotemporal properties of Geopolitical units can be modelled through the properties inherited from E92 Spacetime Volume.\nAnother specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the actual extent of the set of activities and phenomena as evidenced by their physical traces that define a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\n- Jurassic (Hallam, 1975)\n- Populated Period of Nineveh\n- Imperial Rome under Marcus Aurelius\n- European Bronze Age (Harrison, 2004) \n- Italian Renaissance (Macdonald, 1992)\n- Thirty Years War (Lee, 1991)\n- Sturm und Drang (Berkoff, 2013)\n- Cubism (Cox, 2000)\n- The Capital of Russia (E4) [the capital of Russia in the sense of an administrative unit moved in historical times from Moscow to St Petersburg and then back to Moscow.

The actual extent of an instance of E52 Time-Span can be approximated by properties of E52 Time-Span giving inner and outer bounds in the form of dates (instances of E61 Time Primitive). Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.\nSome instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which people can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.\nSome instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract.

Geometrically, instances of E53 Place constitute single contiguous areas or a finite aggregation of disjoint areas in space which are each individually contiguous. They may have fuzzy boundaries.\nThe instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks, but may also be determined by reference to mobile objects. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, people are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object, i.e. H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\nAny instance of E18 Physical Thing can serve as a frame of reference for an instance of E53 Place.

The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluminescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as “diameter” or “length” are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, “maximum linear extent” may be sufficient.\nThe properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.\nNumerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension, as appropriate.\n\nExamples:\n- the weight of the Luxor Obelisk [250 metric tons]\n- the vertical height of the statue of David by Michelangelo [5.17 metres]\n- the weight of the Great Star of Africa diamond [530.2 carats]\n- the calibrated C14 date for the Shroud of Turin [AD1262-1312, 1303-1384]\n- the horizontal diameter of the Stonehenge Sarsen Circle [33 metres] (Pryor, 2016)\n- the length of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza [230.34 metres] (Lehner and Hawass, 2017)\n- the duration of the time-span of the Battle of Issos/Issus on 15(th) November 333 B.C.E.

Similarly, the blowing of the wind lacks the distinctness and limits of an event, but a hurricane, flood or earthquake would qualify as an event. Mental processes are considered as events, in cases where they are connected with the material externalization of their results; for example, the creation of a poem, a performance or a change of intention that becomes obvious from subsequent actions or declarations.\nThe effects of an instance of E5 Event may not lead to relevant permanent changes of properties or relations of the items involved in it, for example an unrecorded performance.

Nevertheless, relevant characteristics used should be sufficiently similar to recognize the instance for some substantial period of time. \nThe more specific criteria that determine the identity of instances of subclasses of E77 Persistent Item may vary considerably and are described or referred to in the respective scope notes. The decision about which exact criteria to use depends on whether the observable behaviour of the respective part of reality such confined conforms to the reasoning the user is interested in. For example, a building can be regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria, such as being bodily separated from other persons. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. On the opposite, the identity of a (version of a) text of a scientific publication is given by the exact arrangement of its relevant symbols. \nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope of the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties. \nAn instance of E77 Persistent Item does not require actual knowledge of the identifying features of the instance being currently known. There may be cases, where the actual identifying features of an instance of E77 Persistent Item are not decidable at a particular state of knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci (E21) (Strano, 1953)\n- Stonehenge (E24) (Pryor, 2016)\n- the hole in the ozone layer (E4) (Hufford and Horwitz, 2005)\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics (E89) (Craig and Gislason, 2002)\n- the Bermuda Triangle (E53) (Dolan, 2005)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E77(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n","label":"E77 Persistent Item","subclass":["crm:E39_Actor","crm:E70_Thing"],"superclass":["crm:E1_CRM_Entity"],"type":"class"},"crm:E78_Collection":{"about":"http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E78_Collection","subclass":["pdt:OWLClassImpl_8fa2b552_0357_457f_bab1_4d39a073e5a5"],"type":"class"},"crm:E78_Curated_Holding":{"about":"http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E78_Curated_Holding","comment":"Scope note:\nThis class comprises aggregations of instances of E18 Physical Thing that are assembled and maintained (“curated” and “preserved,” in museological terminology) by one or more instances of E39 Actor over time for a specific purpose and audience, and according to a particular collection development plan.

The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.\nIn common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as an approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge. \nIn more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature.

The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.\nIn common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as an approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge. \nIn more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature.

Since Time-Spans may not have precisely known temporal extents, the CIDOC CRM supports statements about the minimum and maximum temporal extents of Time-Spans. This property allows a Time-Span’s maximum temporal extent (i.e. its outer boundary) to be assigned an E61 Time Primitive value. Time Primitives are treated by the CIDOC CRM as application or system specific date intervals, and are not further analysed. If different sources of evidence justify different maximum extents without contradicting each other, the resulting intersection of all these extents will be the best estimate. This should be taken into account for information integration.\n\nExamples:\n- The time-span of the development of the CIDOC CRM (E52) at some time within “1992-infinity” (E61).

Spelling variants are regarded as different nomens, whereas the use of different fonts (visual representation variants) or different digital encodings do not change the identity.\nAn arbitrary combination of signs or symbols cannot be regarded as an appellation or designation until it is associated with something in some context. In that sense, the F12 Nomen class can be understood as the reification of a relationship between an instance of E1 CRM Entity and an instance of E41 Appellation. Two instances of F12 Nomen can happen to be associated with equivalent strings and yet remain distinct, as long as they refer to distinct instances of E1 CRM Entity. Furthermore, two instances of F12 Nomen referring to the same instance of E1 CRM Entity may be associated with equivalent strings, and remain distinct as long as they are associated with distinct properties of the F12 Nomen class (for example, having the same spelling in different languages, or being defined in different controlled vocabularies).\nAn instance of F12 Nomen associates a combination of signs with an instance of E1 CRM Entity on the basis of a cultural or linguistic convention: by associating a string with anything, the instance of F12 Nomen establishes a meaning that is not inherent in the instance of E62 String that is associated with it. Depending on context of use, nomens associated with equivalent strings can be associated with instances of different things in the real world even within the same language (polysemy and homonymy). Conversely, the same thing can be referred to through any number of nomens (synonymy). In the controlled environment of a bibliographic information system, though, homonymy is avoided.\nInstances of F12 Nomen are assigned and associated with instances of E1 CRM Entity either formally (such as by bibliographic agencies) or informally through common usage. When they are assigned formally, the construction of the instances of E62 String that represent them may follow predetermined rules.\n\nExamples:\n- ‘杜甫’ as the name for a Chinese poet of the 8(th) century, rendered in simplified Chinese characters\n- ‘Du Fu’ as the name for a Chinese poet of the 8(th) century, rendered in Pinyin romanised form\n- ‘Tu Fu’ as the name for a Chinese poet of the 8(th) century, rendered in another romanised form\n- ‘Thơ Ðô Phủ’ as the name for a Chinese poet of the 8(th) century, rendered in a Vietnamese form\n- ‘جامعة صفاقس’ as the name for Sfax University (Tunisia), rendered in Arabic in Arabic script\n- ‘Ğāmi‘at̀̀ Ṣafāqis’ as the name for Sfax University (Tunisia), rendered in transliterated Arabic\n- ‘Université de Sfax’ as the name for Sfax University (Tunisia), rendered in French\n- ‘3-[(2S)-1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl]pyridine’ as the term for nicotine, rendered in the IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry\n- ‘Murders in the rue Morgue’ as the title of the textual work by Edgar Allan Poe, in English\n- ‘Poe, Edgar Allan, 1809-1849.

An instance of F2 Expression is considered to be created when it is captured on a carrier other than the creator’s brain.\nAlthough F2 Expression is an abstract entity, a conceptual object, the creation of an expression inevitably also affects the physical world: when you scribble the first draft of a poem on a sheet of paper, you produce an instance of F3 Manifestation and an instance of F5 Item. F28 Expression Creation is a subclass of E12 Production because the recording of the expression causes a physical modification of the E18 Physical Thing that serves as the carrier.

The substance of F2 Expression is signs.\nAn Expression is the outcome of the intellectual or creative process of realizing a Work. Subsequent expressions conveying the same work may be created over time.\nExpressions do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only instances of F2 Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s brain and an auditor’s brain are taken into account.\nThe form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression. Differences in form imply different Expressions (e.g., from text to spoken word, a transcript of a recording). Similarly, differences in language or means of performance imply different Expressions (e.g., translations or arrangements for different instruments). Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the result is considered to be a new F2 Expression. While theoretically any change in signs will result in a new Expression, conventionally the context and use will determine the rules for distinguishing among expressions.\nAn instance of F2 Expression which includes spoken or written text may be multiply instantiated as an instance of E33 Linguistic Object.

A Manifestation is defined by both the overall content and the form of its presentation. The substance of F3 Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.\nAn F3 Manifestation is the outcome of a publication process where one or more F2 Expressions are prepared for public dissemination, but it may also be a unique form created directly on some material carrier without the intent of being formally published.\nAn instance of F3 Manifestation typically incorporates one or more instances of F2 Expression representing a distinct logical content and all additional input by a publisher such as text layout and cover design. Additionally an F3 Manifestation can be identified by the physical features for the medium of distribution, if applicable. For example, publications in the form of hard-cover and paperback editions would be two distinct instances of F3 Manifestation, even though authorial and editorial content are otherwise identical in both publications.\nIn the case of industrial products such as printed books or music CDs, but also digital material, an instance of F3 Manifestation can be regarded as the prototype for all copies of it. In these cases, an instance of F3 Manifestation specifies all of the features or traits that instances of F5 Item display in order to be copies of a particular publication.

Groups that are constituted as meetings, conferences, congresses, expeditions, festivals, fairs, etc. are examples of F55 Collective Agent as long as they self-identify by a specific name, rather than being referred to by a generic description of the gathering, and can act as a unit (such as by publishing their proceedings, or approving a report). These collective actions may be performed by representatives selected by the whole, rather than by all individual members acting together.\nCollective Agents may be members of other Collective Agents, although directly or indirectly all Collective Agents are composed of persons. The membership of many types of Collective Agents will continue to evolve over time. A Collective Agent may continue to exist even if it has no members for a time (for example, a committee whose members all resign prior to the expiration of their terms but then a new complement of members is appointed).\nInstances of F55 Collective Agent include instances of its subclass F11 Corporate Body: commercial or corporate entities and other legally registered bodies, as well as organizations and associations, musical, artistic or performing groups, governments, and any of their sub-units.\nMarried couples and other concepts of family (instances of F39 Family) are instances of a subclass of F55 Collective Agent.\nIn the wider sense, this class also comprises holders of official positions viewed collectively, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country.

An instance of F5 Item that is stored on a part of a larger physical support (such as an electronic file among others on a disc) can also be considered to be an instance of E25 Human-Made Feature.\nThe notion of F5 Item is only relevant with regard to the production process, from a bibliographic point of view.

Typically instances of E90 Symbolic Object that are of interest as fragments of expressions are formed deliberately, such as when excerpts are taken from a text by the compiler of a collection of excerpts, or citations from one expression are used in another text.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The ancient Greek text of the four stanzas from an ode by Sappho (E33) that were quoted by Pseudo-Longinus in his textual work entitled ‘On the sublime’ is fragment of the complete ancient Greek text, now irremediably lost, of Sappho’s ode currently identified as Sappho’s poem #2 (F2).\n- The phrase ‘Beati pauperes spiritu’ (E33) is fragment of the Latin text of the Gospel according to St. Matthew (F2). [excerpt from Matthew 5,3]\n- The stanza ‘Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita / mi ritrovai per una selva oscura / ché la diritta via era smarrita’ (E33) is fragment of the Italian text of Dante Alighieri’s ‘Inferno’ from the ‘Divina Commedia’ (F2).\n- The widely recognized ominous four-note opening motif (E73) is fragment of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony (F2).\n- The melting clock (E36) is fragment of the painting ‘Persistence of Memory’ by Salvador Dali, 1931 (F2).\n","domain":"crm:E90_Symbolic_Object","label":"R15i is fragment of","range":"lrmoo:F2_Expression","superproperty":["crm:P106i_forms_part_of"],"type":"property"},"lrmoo:R16_created":{"about":"http://iflastandards.info/ns/lrm/lrmoo/R16_created","comment":"Quantification: one to many, necessary, dependent (1,n:1,1)\n\nScope note:\nThis property associates the initial creation of a work and the instance of F1 Work that was created.\n\nExamples:\n- Agatha Christie creating ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ (F27), created the work ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ (F1).\n- Mary Shelley creating ‘Frankenstein, or, The Modern Prometheus’ (F27), created the work ‘Frankenstein, or, The Modern Prometheus’ (F1).\n- Dante creating the poem ‘Divina Commedia’ (F27), created the work ‘Divina Commedia’ (F1).\n- William Shakespeare creating ‘The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark’(F27), created the work ‘The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark’ (F1).\n- René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo (collaboratively) creating ‘Astérix le Gaulois’ (F27) created the work ‘Astérix le Gaulois’ (F1).\n- The work creation event of Ludwig van Beethoven composing his ‘Symphony No. 9’ (F27) created the work ‘Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9’ (F1).\n- Johann Sebastian Bach composing the ‘Goldberg Variations’ (F27) created the work the ‘Goldberg Variations’ (F1).\n- The making of ‘Jules et Jim’, directed by François Truffault (F27) created the work ‘Jules et Jim’ (F1).\n- The making of ‘Psycho’, directed by Alfred Hitchcock (F27) created the work ‘Psycho’ (F1).\n- Auguste Rodin creating ‘Le Penseur’ (The Thinker) (F27), created the work ‘Le Penseur’ (The Thinker) (F1).\n- Picasso creating ‘Guernica’ (F27) created the work ‘Guernica’ (F1).\n","domain":"lrmoo:F27_Work_Creation","label":"R16 created","range":"lrmoo:F1_Work","superproperty":["crm:P94_has_created"],"type":"property"},"lrmoo:R16i_was_created_by":{"about":"http://iflastandards.info/ns/lrm/lrmoo/R16i_was_created_by","comment":"Quantification of the inverse property: one to many, necessary, dependent (1,n:1,1)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property associates the initial creation of a work and the instance of F1 Work that was created.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- Agatha Christie creating ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ (F27), created the work ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ (F1).\n- Mary Shelley creating ‘Frankenstein, or, The Modern Prometheus’ (F27), created the work ‘Frankenstein, or, The Modern Prometheus’ (F1).\n- Dante creating the poem ‘Divina Commedia’ (F27), created the work ‘Divina Commedia’ (F1).\n- William Shakespeare creating ‘The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark’(F27), created the work ‘The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark’ (F1).\n- René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo (collaboratively) creating ‘Astérix le Gaulois’ (F27) created the work ‘Astérix le Gaulois’ (F1).\n- The work creation event of Ludwig van Beethoven composing his ‘Symphony No. 9’ (F27) created the work ‘Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9’ (F1).\n- Johann Sebastian Bach composing the ‘Goldberg Variations’ (F27) created the work the ‘Goldberg Variations’ (F1).\n- The making of ‘Jules et Jim’, directed by François Truffault (F27) created the work ‘Jules et Jim’ (F1).\n- The making of ‘Psycho’, directed by Alfred Hitchcock (F27) created the work ‘Psycho’ (F1).\n- Auguste Rodin creating ‘Le Penseur’ (The Thinker) (F27), created the work ‘Le Penseur’ (The Thinker) (F1).\n- Picasso creating ‘Guernica’ (F27) created the work ‘Guernica’ (F1).\n","domain":"lrmoo:F1_Work","label":"R16i was created by","range":"lrmoo:F27_Work_Creation","superproperty":["crm:P94i_was_created_by"],"type":"property"},"lrmoo:R17_created":{"about":"http://iflastandards.info/ns/lrm/lrmoo/R17_created","comment":"Quantification: one to many, necessary, dependent (1,n:1,1)\n\nScope note:\nThis property associates an instance of F2 Expression that was externalised during a particular instance of F28 Expression Creation event with that particular creation event.
